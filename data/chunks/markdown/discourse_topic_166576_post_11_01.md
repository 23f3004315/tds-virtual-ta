Wrong / Confusing question Prof

The top line mentions “Saturdays” whereas the bottom line mentions “Sundays”

Please clarify “SUNDAY” or “SATURDAY”?

**[Discussion Image by 23f1003186]** This image is a task description for a data analysis assignment focused on analyzing web server access logs to determine peak usage for regional content on the website s-anand.net. The assignment requires calculating the number of successful GET requests (status codes 200-299) for pages under the `/telugu/` section made on Saturdays between 13:00 and 23:00 during May 2024. The data source is a GZipped Apache log file (61MB, 258,074 rows) where fields are space-separated and quoted, except for the `Time` field, and all timestamps are in GMT-0500. The student needs to handle potentially complex parsing due to non-standard formatting, including escaped quotes in some lines (impacting 41 rows), and understand the structure of a typical Apache log entry, including fields like IP address, remote logname, remote user, time, request (method, URL, protocol), status, size, referer, user agent, vhost, and server.dling the "Time" field which is not quoted, and the 41 rows with unique quoting issues; extracting the GET requests and their timestamps are crucial for answering the assignment question." alt="grab-IIT-Madras--Microsoft Edge_at_21.44.39_on__14-02-2025__003253" data-base62-sha1="lCU1jU8E89JBWoznNnS71PMwjNE" width="528" height="499" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1003186]** This image shows the assignment context for "GA5 - Data Preparation - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]," specifically post #11 by user 23f1003186, outlining a peak usage analysis task for regional content on the "s-anand.net" website, focusing on the "telugu" section. Students must determine the number of successful GET requests for pages under /telugu/ from 13:00 until before 23:00 on Saturdays in May 2024, using Apache web server access logs, also considering timezone and log file format challenges with quoted fields. This involves extracting data from a GZipped Apache log file (61MB with 258,074 rows), considering timestamps and HTTP status codes between 200 and 299 to identify successful requests. The image describes the different fields in the log files and specific instructions to consider minor formatting issues (41 rows have unique quoting)., **[Discussion Image by 23f1003186]** This image presents the problem statement for a data analysis task focusing on peak usage analysis for the website s-anand.net. As a data analyst, the task is to determine the number of successful GET requests for pages under /telugu/ made on Saturdays between 13:00 and 23:00 during May 2024, using a gzipped Apache log file. The log data's characteristics include being recorded in the GMT-0500 timezone and having a non-standard format with space-separated fields quoted by double quotes, except for the 'Time' field, also, fields are escaped via backslash and not double double quotes, impacting 41 rows. The solution will involve extracting and filtering log entries based on time, request type (GET), HTTP status codes (200-299), and the URL containing '/telugu/', with the context indicating it is for optimizing infrastructure, content delivery, and marketing efforts. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1003186]** This image presents the context and requirements for a data analysis task. The scenario involves analyzing web server logs from s-anand.net, a website with music content, to understand peak usage. The task is to determine the number of successful GET requests for pages under the `/telugu/` path made on Saturdays between 13:00 and 23:00 in May 2024, based on HTTP status codes between 200 and 299. The challenge lies in the log file format, which uses spaces for field separation, double quotes for most fields (except the time field), and escaped quotes for some rows. The log data is in GMT-0500 timezone. The dataset comes from an Apache log file (61MB, 258,074 rows) containing fields like IP, remote logname, remote user, time, request, status, size, referer, user agent, vhost, and server. 2x" data-dominant-color="F1F1F1">grab-IIT-Madras--Microsoft Edge_at_21.44.39_on__14-02-2025__0032531920×1816 271 KB
