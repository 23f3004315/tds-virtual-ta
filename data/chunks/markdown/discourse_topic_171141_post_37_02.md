**[Discussion Image by Pritul_raut]** This image shows a snippet of Python code from the `app.py` file within the LLM-based-Automation-Agent project on GitHub. The code defines several API endpoints using FastAPI decorators (`@app.get`, `@app.post`). Specifically, the `read_file` function is designed to read the content of a file specified by a path, including error handling for cases where the path is missing, the file doesn't exist, or the file is not within the designated data folder. The right side panel of the screenshot displays a "Symbols" list, showing definitions like `ai_proxy_url`, functions like `read_file`, and constants used in the code. A student likely posted this code to highlight potential issues or discrepancies in the project's file handling logic, particularly concerning the `read_file` function's path validation and error responses.the file, suggesting the student is likely exploring or debugging the codebase. The discussion centers on code discrepancies in the `app.py` file of the LLM-based-Automation-Agent project, prompting students to analyze specific functions and potential error conditions." alt="Screenshot (179)" data-base62-sha1="14BbmQkfIVUg0JdjR6HlE90whq2" width="690" height="388" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Pritul_raut]** This image shows a snippet of the `app.py` file from the `LLM-based-Automation-Agent` GitHub repository, likely shared by a student named Pritul_raut in the context of the TDS project 1 discrepancies discussion. The code includes functions for handling `/start`, `/read`, and `/run` endpoints using FastAPI. The `/read` endpoint has logic to check for the file path's existence and whether it resides in the data folder, raising HTTPExceptions for various error scenarios, such as missing path, file not found, or path not in the data folder. On the right side, the "Symbols" pane in the GitHub interface is visible, listing functions and constants defined in the file, like `ai_proxy_url`, `read_file`, and `run_task`, which aids in code navigation. The student likely shared the code for review and discussion to address potential issues or differences in implementation., **[Discussion Image by Pritul_raut]** This image shows a snippet of the `app.py` file from the "LLM-based-Automation-Agent" project repository on GitHub, potentially as part of a student's project submission or while seeking assistance. The code includes API endpoints defined using `@app.get` and `@app.post` decorators for handling requests to "/" and "/read" routes, plus a "/run" route that takes task as input. The `read_file` function attempts to read and return the content of a file specified by the path, raising HTTPExceptions for scenarios such as missing file paths, non-existent files, and errors when the file path is not in the data folder, with status codes 400, 404 and 500 respectively. The right sidebar displays a "Symbols" panel, listing defined constants and functions within the file such as `ai_proxy_url`, `start`, `read_file`, `run_task`, and `is_path_in_data_folder`. This context points to a peer discussion where the original poster is referencing the code as part of the troubleshooting process. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Pritul_raut]** This image shows a student sharing code from the `app.py` file within the "LLM-based-Automation-Agent" project on GitHub, which serves as part of a peer discussion related to discrepancies. The code defines FastAPI endpoints for "/" (start), "/read", and "/run", including error handling for file access. Specifically, the `/read` endpoint attempts to read a file specified by a 'path' parameter, checking if the path exists, if it's in the data folder, and then returning the file's content or raising HTTPException with codes 400 (File path is required), 404 (File not found), or 500 (Internal Server Error). The right sidebar displays a "Symbols" list within the file, enabling quick navigation to definitions such as `ai_proxy_url`, functions like `start` and `read_file`, and other constants and functions. Student confusion and resolution outcomes aren't directly evident in this image, but the provided code is core to the project functionality. 2x" data-dominant-color="1D2228">Screenshot (179)1920×1080 199 KB
