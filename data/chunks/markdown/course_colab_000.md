## Notebooks: Google Colab

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a free, cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that's become indispensable for data scientists and ML practitioners. It's particularly valuable because it provides free access to GPUs and TPUs, and for easy sharing of code and execution results.

While Colab is excellent for prototyping and learning, its free tier has limitations - notebooks time out after 12 hours, and GPU access can be inconsistent.

Learn how to mount Google Drive for persistent storage, manage dependencies with `!pip install` commands, as these are common pain points when getting started.

[**[Course Image: Get started with Google Colaboratory (3 min)]** This image represents an introductory tutorial to Google Colaboratory ("Colab"), which is a free cloud-based platform for coding in Python, especially for machine learning. Colab eliminates the need to install and configure software dependencies locally, allowing users to focus on coding. Students can leverage Colab to execute Python code and perform tasks related to Coding TensorFlow by installing required packages using `!pip install` commands directly within the Colab notebook. This is a critical skill, as installing dependencies is often a common first step in any coding project. Mastering this allows you to quickly set up your coding environment and start working on your TDS projects and assignments in Colab.on to Google Colaboratory, often called "Colab," a free cloud-based platform for machine learning education and research. Colab provides a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud, making it accessible to anyone with a Google account. A key learning objective is to understand Colab's ease of use and accessibility for coding TensorFlow and other Python-based machine learning projects. This introduction helps students overcome initial hurdles and start experimenting with code without local environment configurations, which is especially relevant when addressing common pain points in getting started with machine learning. Understanding the basics of Colab is crucial for completing assignments and projects in the TDS course, where hands-on coding is emphasized.)](https://youtu.be/inN8seMm7UI)
