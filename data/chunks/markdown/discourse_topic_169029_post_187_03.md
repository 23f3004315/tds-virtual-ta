**[Discussion Image by 22f2001590]** This image depicts a code snippet from a student's work on "Project 2 - TDS Solver," likely during the debugging or development phase. The code appears to be fetching data from IMDb using a proxy to circumvent CORS issues, specifically searching for titles based on user ratings. The code includes error handling for cases where IMDb data cannot be retrieved, throwing an error message. The fetched HTML is parsed using DOMParser, and data such as id, title, year, and rating are extracted using querySelector and regular expressions; `Array(25)` is assigned to variable `l` within a map function that iterates over the parsed IMDb metadata list. This is a peer discussion, and others viewing this code may use this information to help debug or enhance their TDS Solver project.xtracts the `id`, `title`, `year`, and `rating` from the corresponding HTML elements using `querySelector` and `textContent`. There's a line `l = Array(25)` inside the `.map()` function, suggesting a misunderstanding or debugging attempt related to array manipulation. The return object contains `id`, `title`, `year`, and `rating` extracted from the HTML." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="vYbhYSQIOVMvOpLeeaXxRBaeqy4" width="690" height="189" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f2001590]** This image depicts a code snippet from a student's project related to fetching and parsing data from IMDb using a proxy server, most likely in the context of the TDS solver project. The code defines an asynchronous function `g` that takes two parameters, `r` and `n`, likely representing user ratings. Inside the function, a `fetch` call is made to a proxy server with a URL that includes `r` and `n` to retrieve IMDb data. If the `fetch` call is successful (h.ok), the text content is extracted; otherwise, an error is thrown indicating the inability to get IMDb data, along with the status and status text from the response. Further code uses DOMParser to parse the HTML response, extracts specific elements such as title, year, and rating using querySelector, and returns them in a formatted object, indicating it is part of the data extraction and transformation process to solve the project., **[Discussion Image by 22f2001590]** This image captures a code snippet from a student's work on the TDS Solver project, specifically addressing the retrieval and parsing of IMDb data. The code defines an asynchronous function `g` that fetches data from an IMDb search endpoint using a proxy, constructed with user rating parameters `r` and `n`. The code handles potential errors by throwing an error message if the fetch request fails. If successful, it parses the HTML response using `DOMParser`, extracts specific elements using `querySelectorAll` and `querySelector` (e.g., title, year, rating), and returns an object containing this extracted data, including IMDb ID, title, year, and rating. The student may be having issues related to data retrieval, parsing, or correct implementation of the proxy URL. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f2001590]** This image shows a code snippet likely from a student's attempt to solve the TDS project, specifically focusing on fetching and parsing IMDB data. The code defines an asynchronous function `g` that fetches data from an IMDB search endpoint using `fetch()` behind a proxy. Error handling is included, throwing an error if the fetch is not successful. If the fetch is successful, the code then parses the HTML response using `DOMParser` and extracts specific elements like title, id, year, and rating using `querySelectorAll` and `querySelector`. This suggests the student is working on scraping data from the IMDB website to fulfill a project requirement but may be facing issues with the `fetch()` call or subsequent data extraction. 2x" data-dominant-color="F8F5F5">image733Ã—201 38.2 KB
