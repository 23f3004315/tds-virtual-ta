Hi @s.anand @jkmadathil @Bharathi @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

Could you please look into the above issue?

Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:

**Grading Concerns**
**Final Course Score:**

T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F

(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)

From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:

What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?.

Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores.

Furthermore, for Project 1 (**deadline: 16th Feb 2025**), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.
