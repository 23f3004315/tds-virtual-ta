Dear TDS Team,

I have verified my submission, and my repository **does include a Dockerfile**, and the **Docker image is accessible on DockerHub**. Please find the attached screenshot as proof. Kindly review my submission again and let me know if any further action is needed.

Looking forward to your confirmation.

Best regards,
