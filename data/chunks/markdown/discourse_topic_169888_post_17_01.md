 assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024 December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well.

[Quote]: 
Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)

Shall I delete the records for which price is not available?

**[Discussion Image by Nelson]** This is a screenshot from a student discussion thread focused on data visualization (GA7 - Data Visualisation - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]). The image depicts a spreadsheet, likely in Google Sheets or Excel, displaying a table of pharmaceutical items along with their monthly sales data for the year 2023, where column A lists drug "Item", and subsequent columns show "Year" and "Month" sales. Specifically, the "ACE inhibitors" and "Antacids" rows have '0' values in the "Total" column, whereas other items have monthly sales data starting from column D (M01-Jan) onward. The red arrows point to "ACE inhibitors" and "Antacids", possibly indicating an area of student confusion or a specific data point being discussed. The context is unclear but could relate to why these specific drug groups have zero totals.showing a table with 'Item' names (like "ACE inhibitors", "Analgesics", "Antacids") and corresponding monthly data for 2023. The "ACE inhibitors" and "Antacids" rows both have zero values under the "Total" column, and the red box seems to highlight the Year and Month columns which could be used to filter or group the data, suggesting the user is trying to understand why they get zero totals despite the presence of monthly values. This is a data visualization issue related to how the source data is organized and displayed, showing data aggregation challenges." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="3LIFduVmIH83bRYLkJWJn52sZEC" width="689" height="346" data-dominant-color="EBE9EC">image1290Ã—648 53.1 KB
