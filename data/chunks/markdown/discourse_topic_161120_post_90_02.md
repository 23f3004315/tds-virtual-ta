 I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.

**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image serves as supplementary learning material within a TDS discussion thread, likely to provide context or visual aid related to deployment tools. The image titled "PORTS EXPLAINED" displays a comprehensive list of common network port numbers along with their corresponding service descriptions, such as FTP (21), SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and RDP (3389). On the right side, there is a visual representation of a server rack with various monitoring dashboards displaying metrics like IP addresses, server status, fan RPM, temperature, and other server performance indicators. This suggests the discussion involves understanding network configurations, service deployment, and server infrastructure management. The animated tag at the bottom may indicate the image is part of a video or interactive resource aimed at simplifying complex networking concepts.. The image broadly explains common ports and their associated protocols. On the left, it presents a list of common ports with their descriptions and corresponding port numbers such as FTP (21), SSH (22), Telnet (23), MTP (25), and RDP (3389). On the right, there's a stylized representation of a server rack displaying network parameters like IP addresses, server status, fan RPM, temperature, and storage utilization, designed to help students visualize the concepts related to deployment and networking. The "PORTS EXPLAINED" title suggests a focus on demystifying network communications for students learning deployment techniques." title="Network Ports Explained" data-dominant-color="206845" width="690" height="388">
