**[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image shows a snippet from a student's Postman request, likely during a peer discussion or troubleshooting. The student is making a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api` or `shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs`. The response body displayed in the HTML view includes a `` tag sourcing `swagger-ui-bundle.js` from a CDN, indicating the student is likely trying to implement Swagger UI. The subsequent script initializes SwaggerUIBundle with the URL `/openapi.json` and configures the UI element. The status code is 200 OK, suggesting the request was successful, but the student may be facing issues with displaying the Swagger UI as intended.eans the API endpoint is accessible and returns content. The student may be troubleshooting why the Swagger UI is not rendering as expected, and this view offers a look at the returned HTML content." alt="post" data-base62-sha1="osCebqbvGLvJqudqvYFnlkFOjVU" width="690" height="457" srcset="**[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image shows a student using Postman to interact with their TDS project's API, likely as part of Project 2. The student has entered "http://localhost:8000/api" and "shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs" in the URL bar, using the POST method. The Headers tab shows (9) headers and the Cookies shows (6). The Body tab displays HTML code that includes a script tag referencing "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swagger-ui-dist@5/swagger-ui-bundle.js", indicating the use of Swagger UI for API documentation. The student is inspecting the HTML response which initializes Swagger UI with the openapi.json file. The status at the bottom shows "Status: 200 OK", which suggests that the request to the /api endpoint was successful, implying that the student is likely verifying the API endpoint's documentation or response using Postman and Swagger., **[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image captures a student's interaction with Postman while working on the TDS project. The student has sent a POST request to "http://localhost:8000/api" and is examining the response body, specifically the HTML. The HTML code reveals that the student is trying to integrate Swagger UI into their application, evident from the "swagger-ui" div and the script tag that loads the Swagger UI bundle from a CDN. The Swagger UI configuration, including the URL for the OpenAPI JSON file ('/openapi.json') and the DOM ID ('#swagger-ui'), is also visible within a JavaScript code block. The Postman UI indicates a successful request with a Status of 200 OK, a response time of 286ms, and a size of 1.11 KB. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image depicts a student's interaction with Postman, attempting to access the Swagger UI for the TDS project API, likely a peer discussion or self-troubleshooting based on the project context. The student is sending a POST request to the Azure-hosted API endpoint and the response body contains HTML code for rendering the Swagger UI. The code includes a div with id "swagger-ui" and a script tag that loads the Swagger UI bundle from a CDN. Javascript code is present to configure the swagger UI using the 'SwaggerUIBundle' function and pointing to the 'openapi.json' file. The request returns a 200 OK status, but the student may be encountering issues with properly rendering or displaying the Swagger UI based on the HTML response in Postman, rather than a fully functional interface. 2x" data-dominant-color="212222">post1535Ã—1018 36.8 KB
