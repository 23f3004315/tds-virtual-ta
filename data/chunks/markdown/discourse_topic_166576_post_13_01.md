 if the answer to this question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here, however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public forum.

Please consider my request and double check-

@Jivraj, @carlton

Thank you

**[Discussion Image by 23f1003186]** This image shows the case study description for the TDS student discussion "GA5 - Data Preparation". The case study, "Recovering Sales Data for ReceiptRevive Analytics", involves working with legacy sales data from paper receipts that have been digitized using OCR, leading to incomplete JSON data due to truncation or missing values. The task requires parsing a JSON file containing 100 rows of sales data, validating and cleaning the data (primarily focusing on sales values since the `id` field is missing), and calculating the total sales. The goal is to provide RetailFlow Inc. with insights into historical sales performance and enable them to make informed business decisions. Students are instructed to download the data from the provided "q-parse-partial-json.jsonl" link. The image sets the context and requirements for a data preparation task where students must handle incomplete data and focus on extracting meaningful information (sales figures) despite the presence of missing values. focus should be on sales figures.

It details the problem of recovering sales data from incomplete JSON data resulting from OCR processing of damaged receipts. The task requires parsing a JSON file containing 100 rows of sales data, handling missing 'id' fields, and accurately extracting the 'sales' values. Students must then calculate the total sales by summing the 'sales' values across all rows and download the data from the specified link: "q-parse-partial-json.jsonl". The missing 'id' field is a key point, emphasizing the focus on 'sales' values for data validation and the final calculation., **[Discussion Image by 23f1003186]** This image is a screenshot of the case study description for the "GA5 - Data Preparation" assignment, focusing on "Recovering Sales Data for ReceiptRevive Analytics." It outlines the problem scenario, where a data recovery firm (ReceiptRevive) needs to recover sales data from digitized receipts for RetailFlow Inc. The data is in JSON format, but is incomplete due to OCR issues, specifically missing 'id' fields in some entries. The task requires parsing the provided JSON file ("q-parse-partial-json.jsonl"), extracting the 'sales' figures from each row, and calculating the total sales. The description also explains the business value for RetailFlow Inc., such as historical data reconstruction and informed decision-making. The focus is on handling incomplete data and prioritizing the accurate extraction and aggregation of sales values. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1003186]** This image shows the problem description for the TDS student discussion "GA5 - Data Preparation" assignment, posted by 23f1003186. The case study involves ReceiptRevive Analytics recovering sales data from digitized receipts, which have been partially corrupted during OCR, resulting in missing 'id' fields in the JSON data. The student's task is to parse a JSON file with 100 rows, extract sales figures despite the data truncation, perform data validation focusing solely on sales values due to the missing 'id' fields, and calculate the total sales by summing the sales values across all rows. The JSON file can be downloaded via the link "q-parse-partial-json.jsonl" provided at the end of the description, and students need to focus on extracting the "sales" field to sum for the total sales value. The problem emphasizes handling incomplete data and prioritizing the extraction and aggregation of sales information despite the absence of the 'id' field, demonstrating how to handle imperfect OCR data. 2x" data-dominant-color="F0F0F0">grab-IIT-Madras--Microsoft Edge_at_23.15.25_on__14-02-2025__0032551920×1317 210 KB
