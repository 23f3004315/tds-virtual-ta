## Post #23 by 23f3001745

There are a total of 57 questions in all 5 GAs(18+10+9+10+10).

Due to so many different formats of accepting questions and solving them, my main question is:

Is the main essence of this project related to deciphering cryptic js code in order to scrape it?

Some other doubts are

Some questions ask for you to access some hidden divs in the html page and use that for solving (like week 1 q11)
Some questions ask you for AIPROXY TOKENs (like week 3 q9)
Some questions required manual correction to get correct answers (like week 4 q2)
Some questions require file output (like week 2 q2)

How do we account for this? @Jivraj @s.anand @carlton
