## Post #101 by 23f3004068

**Direct Link**: [Post #101](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/171141/101)

Sir, my evaluation log file is missing, even though I followed all the steps to generate the Docker image correctly. The system indicates that the server didn’t start within 5 minutes, but when I uploaded it, everything was working fine. I put in a lot of effort into this project, and I’m worried I might receive a zero despite making the submission correctly. Kindly help me resolve this issue. My roll number is 22F3004068.

Additionally, my Docker image ID was **d2f27c03b878**, but the ID mentioned in the email was **dfac8596cd4c**. Please provide clarity on this discrepancy.

I have also attached my Docker log file for reference
