Hi instructors and TAs,

For the different tasks in Phase B, I don’t have a clear idea of what type of a response you expect.

eg.

Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database &amp; Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website &amp; Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - Do you want the query’s response on an output file like A10? or as a response?

I understand that these are broad problems you except us to solve, but it would be helpful to know what type of response you would require.

Thanks,

Trebhuvan
