. *Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!*

I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team &amp; @s.anand for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. **Food for thought! Really!**

As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities.

PS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: **thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design**. At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride.

**TL;DR**

My approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.

Kind regards
