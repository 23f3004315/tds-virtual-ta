**GA Platform Changes:** Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to *Seek* and in GA7, to *Google Forms*. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.

The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.
