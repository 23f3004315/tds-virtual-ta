**[Discussion Image by Jayeshbansal]** This image depicts a student submission that resulted in an error while trying to validate an API endpoint for a task in the "GA3 - Large Language Models" course. The student entered "http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute?q=" as their API endpoint, which triggered a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error message, indicating a problem with the system's ability to access or connect to the provided URL. The prompt from the instructor asks for the API URL and provides an example. The course system attempts to send a GET request to the submitted URL with a task encoded in the query parameter "q" and check if the response matches the expected output, also noting that the arguments must be in the same order as the function definition. Therefore, the error suggests a potential issue with the student's local server not running or being accessible from the testing environment. and argument order. The highlighted input field and the error message indicate that the student's submitted URL is currently unreachable by the testing system." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="tkTn7eoGxjvG2up3VNYbeonSmBQ" width="690" height="100" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Jayeshbansal]** This image depicts a student's attempt to provide their API URL endpoint, specifically `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute?q=`, within a text field, which is then flagged with an error. The error message "TypeError: Failed to fetch" is displayed below the input field, indicating a problem during the process of making a network request to the provided URL. The instruction text states that the system will send a GET request to the provided URL, appending the task as a query parameter `?q=`, and will verify the response against the expected output, also emphasizing the importance of argument order matching the function definition. This suggests a problem connecting to the specified endpoint., **[Discussion Image by Jayeshbansal]** This image captures a student's attempt to provide the API URL endpoint for their implementation, as part of a TDS Large Language Models assignment discussion. The prompt asks for the URL, and includes the example `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`. The student's submitted URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute?q=` is highlighted in a red bordered textbox, signaling an issue and displaying a red exclamation mark. The error message "TypeError: Failed to fetch" is displayed below the textbox, indicating a problem with the provided API endpoint, likely a connection or server-side error. The text below the error message explains that the system will send a GET request to the provided URL with `?q=...` containing a task and that arguments must be in the same order as the function definition. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Jayeshbansal]** This image represents a student submission that is encountering an error when providing the API endpoint for their implementation. The system prompts the student to enter their API URL, suggesting a format like `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`. The student has entered `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute?q=`, which is flagged with an error icon and the "TypeError: Failed to fetch" message. The system indicates that it will verify the implementation by sending a GET request with the `?q=` parameter containing a task, and emphasizes that arguments must be in the same order as the function definition. This suggests a potential problem with either the URL's format, the server not running, or an issue with how the task is being passed in the query parameter. 2x" data-dominant-color="FAF8F9">image1592Ã—233 19.9 KB
