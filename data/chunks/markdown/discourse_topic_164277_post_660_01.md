**[Discussion Image by HARISH.S]** This image shows a student's command-line interaction, likely during the "Project 1" assignment, attempting to list the Dockerfile in the 'hello_world' directory. The student successfully changes the directory to 'hello_world' using `cd hello_world`. However, the subsequent command `^[200~ls -l Dockerfile` results in a "bash: $'\E[200~ls': command not found" error, indicating a malformed or improperly entered command. After this error, the student likely tried `ls -l Dockerfile` to list the file and it correctly displayed the Dockerfile's details (permissions, size, and timestamp). The student then terminates the process using `^C`. hello_world`. An attempt to list the `Dockerfile` using `ls -l Dockerfile` initially fails with a "command not found" error, seemingly due to an unexpected character sequence (`$^[[200~1s`). The student then retries the `ls -l Dockerfile` command, which succeeds, displaying the file's permissions, owner, size, and modification date, indicating the `Dockerfile` exists. Finally, the student appears to terminate the session using `^C` (Ctrl+C)." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="8eyfQqJ8vzcH4OKnZONZa6tydHd" width="690" height="269" data-dominant-color="070906">image885Ã—346 15.3 KB
