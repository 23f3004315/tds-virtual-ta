## Clustering with Python

[**[Course Image: Clustering with Python]** This image is from a Python notebook demonstrating a clustering analysis, specifically focusing on financial data. The data is structured in a table format, with each row representing a cluster, and columns representing various financial metrics such as "size", "Price", "Market Cap", "Free Float Market Cap %", "% ADV", "RoI %", "ROCE %", "EBIT Margin %", "EPS", "PAT %", and "Stock Return %". These features are used to characterize and differentiate the clusters. This helps to identify segments or groups within a dataset based on these financial attributes, aiding in tasks such as investment strategy or risk management. The notebook is likely used to teach how to apply clustering techniques to analyze and understand financial data in Python.rame in a Jupyter Notebook, which is a common tool for data analysis in Python. The DataFrame shows the results of a clustering analysis, where data points (likely stocks or companies, inferred from "Market Cap", "Price", and "Stock Return %") have been grouped into clusters. Each row represents a cluster, and the columns show descriptive statistics for each cluster, such as the average size, price, market capitalization, and various financial ratios. This allows for easy comparison of different clusters based on these metrics. Understanding how to interpret these cluster characteristics is a key outcome of this type of analysis.)](https://youtu.be/lcMWH67TiWE)
