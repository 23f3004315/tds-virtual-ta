 requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN.
Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation?

GA4 Q2 &amp; Q10

Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved.
Reference: GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution

Output Formatting (Multiple Questions)

---

Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\n) and backslashes are added.
Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {“answer”: “result”}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal.

Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions

Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok.
Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated?

Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday’s Session)
Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues:

Platform Capability for GA Tasks

Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably?
Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage.

File Upload Example via Platform API

Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app.
This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input.

General Observations on GA1-5

Output Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems.

Kindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.
