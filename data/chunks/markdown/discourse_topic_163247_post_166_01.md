**[Discussion Image by Parsh_Kalwania]** This image shows the task instructions for a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) assignment where students implement a proof-of-concept API that answers questions based on excerpts from the TypeScript book. The assignment requires the creation of an API endpoint that accepts GET requests with a query parameter `/search?q=question_text` and returns a JSON object containing the "answer" and optional "sources". Example questions and expected answers are provided, and the response text must include the exact answer. Students are prompted to enter the URL of their RAG API endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/search`) and test it by sending questions and verifying that the responses contain the expected answers, using a provided "Check" button to initiate the automated validation. The student has entered `http://127.0.0.1:8010/search` as their API endpoint. that accepts GET requests with a query parameter "/search?q=question_text" and responds with a JSON object containing the "answer" (relevant documentation excerpt) and "sources" (references to the document). The task involves implementing a RAG system using excerpts from the TypeScript book. The interface prompts the user to enter the URL of their RAG API endpoint, shown as `http://127.0.0.1:8010/search`, and includes a "Check" button to test the endpoint against pre-defined questions. The example questions include "What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?" with the answer "fat arrow", and "Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?" with the answer "!!"." alt="Screenshot 2025-06-02 000221" data-base62-sha1="vG53mguSwUsNBbQrGaeVohEdAMF" width="689" height="445" data-dominant-color="282C31">Screenshot 2025-06-02 0002211290Ã—833 39.2 KB
