**[Discussion Image by 22f3002184]** This image shows a student's attempt to answer a question about the maximum latitude of the bounding box for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, using the Nominatim API, likely as part of a TDS assignment. The student's input is "27.7020999". The system returns an error message, "Error: Incorrect latitude. Check OSM ID ending with 8390", indicating that the provided latitude is not the correct answer according to the Nominatim API data and suggesting the student check the OpenStreetMap (OSM) ID ending with 8390. This suggests a troubleshooting step for the student to review the OSM data for Riyadh and verify their latitude calculation. The context likely involves a discussion thread where students are encountering and resolving data sourcing issues related to the Nominatim API.nstance of a student question and an error message, which points to the need for troubleshooting either the student's query or the API response." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="vBpD5BgJiXJwe7XHvc1aQv0Zc89" width="690" height="144" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f3002184]** This image captures a student's attempt to answer a question related to extracting data using the Nominatim API within the TDS Jan 2025 course "GA4 - Data Sourcing." The question asks for the maximum latitude of the bounding box for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The student's entered answer "27.7020999" is flagged as incorrect, triggering the error message "Error: Incorrect latitude. Check OSM ID ending with 8390". This suggests the student is working with OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and that the submission is validated against an OSM ID ending in "8390". The "Impact" section above the question highlights how automating bounding box data extraction improves UrbanRide's routing, fleet allocation, market analysis, and scaling operations., **[Discussion Image by 22f3002184]** This image captures a student's attempt to answer a question regarding the maximum latitude of the bounding box for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia using the Nominatim API within the TDS Jan 2025 course. The student enters "27.7020999" as the latitude value. The system returns an error message: "Error: Incorrect latitude. Check OSM ID ending with 8390", indicating the entered value is not correct according to the OSM data. The student is likely confused or needs help with the correct process or source to find this information using the Nominatim API and should use the provided OSM ID to find a better latitude value. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f3002184]** This image depicts a student's attempt to answer a question regarding the maximum latitude of Riyadh's bounding box using the Nominatim API within the TDS Jan 2025 GA4 Data Sourcing course discussion. The student input the value "27.7020999" into an input field, but the system returned an error message: "Error: Incorrect latitude. Check OSM ID ending with 8390". This indicates that the provided latitude is not accepted and suggests the student needs to verify the OpenStreetMap (OSM) ID ending with 8390 to find the correct latitude. The context suggests that the question is related to an assignment where students need to use an API to retrieve and validate geographic data. The introductory text on "Impact" is unrelated to the student's specific question and shows general benefits of using bounding box data for UrbanRide. 2x" data-dominant-color="F4F3F4">image1757Ã—367 48.3 KB
