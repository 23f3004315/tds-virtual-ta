Please, look over it.

Also, in my docker log file, it is showing the error as:

**[Discussion Image by ROHIT_B_LAKSHMANAN]** This image shows a server-side error log during the TDS project, indicating an issue within the application's execution. Specifically, the log highlights a "FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'system_input.txt'," meaning the application is unable to locate or access the required input file named 'system_input.txt'. The traceback reveals that the error originates from the `extract_specific_text_using_llm` function within `app/function_tasks.py`, and further triggered within the `execute_function_call` function in `app/main.py`. Additional context reveals a "costError": "crypto.createHash is not a function," possibly related to a cryptography module issue, and the server returns a 500 Internal Server Error. It appears the student is facing issues correctly setting up the filepaths or ensuring that the required 'system_input.txt' file exists in the expected directory, and there might be a deeper cryptography issue that needs resolving.e with the crypto library configuration. The output also includes a stack trace, showing the sequence of function calls leading to the error." alt="Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 11.10.03 AM" data-base62-sha1="ldBEby0LkRjZoaTLvE4vhz7dhA5" width="690" height="462" srcset="**[Discussion Image by ROHIT_B_LAKSHMANAN]** This image shows a student's debugging output related to Project 1, specifically an error encountered within the TDS platform while running the "Say Hello Carlton" task. The error messages indicate a "FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'system_input.txt'," stemming from the `extract_specific_text_using_llm` function within `function_tasks.py`, and a preceding "costError": "crypto.createHash is not a function". This led to a 500 Internal Server Error raised by FastAPI. The traceback reveals the error originated in attempts to open and process an expected input file, indicating a potential problem with file paths or file availability in the task's execution environment. This likely represents a student's confusion point about correctly configuring file dependencies within the project., **[Discussion Image by ROHIT_B_LAKSHMANAN]** This image depicts a server-side error log related to a task within a TDS project. The error occurs during the execution of the function `extract_specific_text_using_llm`, specifically when trying to open the file `system_input.txt`. The traceback reveals a `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'system_input.txt'`, indicating that the application cannot find the specified input file at the expected location. Additionally, a cost error is flagged: `'costError': 'crypto.createHash is not a function'`, which might be another issue influencing the process. The log contains details of the API call, arguments passed to the function, and the complete traceback, crucial for debugging the file path or the missing file. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by ROHIT_B_LAKSHMANAN]** This image captures a student's debug output showing a server error during the execution of the "extract_specific_text_using_llm" function within a TDS project, revealing a "FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'system_input.txt'". The traceback indicates the error originates from the function_tasks.py file, specifically where the code attempts to open "system_input.txt" for reading. Prior to the error, the output shows the LLM interaction including token usage and a `costError: 'crypto.createHash is not a function'`. The error propagates up through main.py, ultimately resulting in a 500 Internal Server Error, indicating the server could not successfully process the request due to the missing input file. This highlights a likely misconfiguration in the project setup, where the application cannot locate the required "system_input.txt" file, potentially due to an incorrect path or the file simply not existing in the expected location. 2x" data-dominant-color="F3F2F1">Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 11.10.03 AM2360Ã—1582 503 KB
