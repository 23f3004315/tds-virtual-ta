Generation-Based Automation Agent (No Hard Coding)
**Repository Link:** GitHub - 23f2005593/tds

Currently, it can complete 7 out of 10 tasks. In reality, it can complete 9 out of 10 tasks, but the expected results are not flexible in evaluate.py file.

If we can extract credit card numbers, it will be able to complete 10 out of 10 tasks.

Please contribute to this repository. **We will win together.**
