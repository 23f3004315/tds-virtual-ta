For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next "

Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as

2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt

eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt

That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. @carlton @Jivraj let me know if this is what is expected. since 9-&gt;10 or 209 → 210 is not working
