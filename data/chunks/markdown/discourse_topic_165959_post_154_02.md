**[Discussion Image by 21f3001379]** This image shows a student's question regarding JSON data, specifically related to a data sourcing exercise in the TDS Jan 2025 cohort. The student provides a sample JSON snippet containing `title`, `year`, and `rating` fields. An error message indicates a mismatch in the `title` field at index [1], where the expected value is "2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey" but the actual value, which also appear to be "2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey" (double hyphens are underlined), doesn't match exactly, potentially due to an extra space or hyphen difference that the student needs to resolve in their JSON data. This represents a peer discussion on trouble shooting data validation. The resolution will likely involve careful inspection and correction of the JSON data to ensure it matches the expected format.ng such as whitespace or character encoding, possibly including a hyphen vs space in "Winnie-the-Pooh" vs "Winnie the Pooh". This signifies a potential issue in data validation during the data sourcing process where string comparisons are sensitive to minor variations." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="pY2VEWy5T6Y7BuUEQusFHKNMjuQ" width="690" height="145" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 21f3001379]** This image shows a student posting in the "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]" asking "What is the JSON data?". The student provided a sample JSON data snippet which contains title, year, and rating, but it doesn't seem to be the problem they are facing. An error message "Error: At [1].title: Values don't match." indicates a problem during data validation or import. The "Expected" title is "2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey", while the "Actual" title shown by the student also appears as "2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey", although there is underlining under the "the"s in "Winnie-the-Pooh", indicating a potential typo or whitespace difference causing the mismatch. The student is likely encountering a data validation issue related to subtle string differences between the expected and actual values., **[Discussion Image by 21f3001379]** This image captures a student question about JSON data and a validation error encountered. The student provides sample JSON data with keys "title", "year", and "rating" having corresponding string values. The error message "Error: At [1].title: Values don't match" indicates a discrepancy between the expected and actual values for the "title" field. The expected value is "'2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey'", while the actual value is '"2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey"', suggesting a potential typo or formatting difference (hyphens vs space). This looks like a peer discussion where the student tries to identify the data error in the JSON format, indicated by the error message. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 21f3001379]** The image shows a student question about JSON data and a visible error message. The student posted example JSON with fields for "title", "year", and "rating". An error is reported: "Values don't match. Expected: '2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey'. Actual: '2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey'". The error indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual title values, suggesting a data validation or comparison problem during the data loading/processing phase, most likely during automated testing. There are subtle differences in the strings (hyphens) that cause the error. 2x" data-dominant-color="FAF7F5">image1226×258 13.2 KB
