## Post #690 by kartikay1

**Direct Link**: [Post #690](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/169029/690)

I had completed project 2 but because of a mistake i filled the form with my personal mail id fue to which the project eas not evaluated i fully consider this to be my fault and assure that something like this will not happen in the future .

If my evaluation of project 2 is not done then i will fail the tds course and will have to repeat this course which will cause a financial strain on me

I know that it is difficult for you to consider this request but it is my humblest request if you can just look through the project i tried to complete the project with the best of my abilities

It will be really helpful if you can access the project

My git repository link is - GitHub - kartikayy1/project2final

My vercel link is - https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/
