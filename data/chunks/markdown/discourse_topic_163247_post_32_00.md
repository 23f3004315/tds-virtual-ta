This is regarding Question 2 I tried to find number of tokens for the message. Using chatgpt identified the followings are valid English words for the given text in the question **D** **m** **Ay** **E r u y Vy** **V Ky** **P** **c**. then, checked with https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer. whatever number given by it seems to wrong.

@Jivraj could you inform me where I did mistake
