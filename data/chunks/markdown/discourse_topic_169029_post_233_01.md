**[Discussion Image by 23f1001231]** This image shows instructor guidance on the TDS Solver Project 2, specifically regarding deploying the Python app on Vercel and creating an API endpoint. The instructions state to download the "q-vercel-python.json" file containing marks for 100 students. The API should be structured such that a request like `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y` returns a JSON response with the marks of student X and student Y, formatted as `{"marks": [10, 20]}`. CORS needs to be enabled to allow GET requests, and an example Vercel URL is provided as `https://vercel-tds-one.vercel.app/api`. This example serves as a model to help students understand what their deployed application URL should resemble.sponse `{"marks": [10, 20]}`. A question is posed regarding the structure of the Vercel URL, and a sample URL `https://vercel-tds-one.vercel.app/api` is given to illustrate what the Vercel URL should look like." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="oRpfRC7kEJsdjV2TczBImH3irVk" width="690" height="174" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1001231]** This image captures instructor guidance within the TDS "Project 2" discussion thread, outlining the steps to deploy a Python app to Vercel for retrieving student marks. It provides a downloadable "q-vercel-python.json" file containing marks for 100 students and instructs how to create an API that responds to requests like `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y` with a JSON object containing the marks of students X and Y (e.g., `{"marks": [10, 20]}`). The instructor emphasizes the need to enable CORS and provides an example of what the Vercel URL should resemble: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`, further illustrated with the specific URL `https://vercel-tds-one.vercel.app/api`. This helps students understand the expected API structure and URL format for their deployed Vercel application., **[Discussion Image by 23f1001231]** This image provides instructions for deploying a Python application to Vercel for a TDS project. It details that a student needs to download a "q-vercel-python.json" file containing student data and deploy a Python application to Vercel that exposes an API. The API should accept requests like "https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y" and return a JSON response containing the marks for the names X and Y in the order they were given, in a format like '{ "marks": [10, 20] }'. The image also specifies the importance of enabling CORS to permit GET requests from any origin and gives an example of a valid Vercel URL: "https://vercel-tds-one.vercel.app/api". 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1001231]** This image represents a task description within a discussion thread, specifically for "Project 2 - TDS Solver". The instructions prompt students to download a `q-vercel-python.json` file containing student marks, and then create and deploy a Python app on Vercel that exposes an API. The API should accept `name` parameters in the URL and return a JSON response containing the marks for the names X and Y in the order they are received, such as `{"marks": [10, 20]}`. Crucially, students are reminded to enable CORS to permit GET requests from any origin, and a sample Vercel URL `https://vercel-tds-one.vercel.app/api` is provided as a reference for what the final URL should resemble. 2x" data-dominant-color="24282D">image1548Ã—391 39.2 KB
