Also noteworthy
Bonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future.

None of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, “at least you should let us know before GA7”. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks?

Bonuses are always surprise opportunities that are *not* widely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement!

**Bonuses are not a right.** They are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life.

However we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms:
