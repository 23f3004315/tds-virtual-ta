**[Discussion Image by 22f3001315]** This image captures a student's question about the correct format of a Vercel URL, along with an example URL provided: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`. The student has input the URL `https://markdarshan.vercel.app/api` into a field, but the application returns an error: "TypeError: Failed to fetch". This indicates a problem with the provided URL and the application's ability to retrieve data from it, likely due to network issues, an incorrect URL, or a problem with the API endpoint itself. The student is likely seeking guidance on troubleshooting this error and understanding the expected Vercel URL structure for their deployed application. common deployment issue related to URL configuration and network errors." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-12 223956" data-base62-sha1="y6IEiua4zSsQpJPTUtUk77zEKQP" width="690" height="65" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f3001315]** This image captures a student's question regarding the correct format of a Vercel URL, referencing the example URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`. The student then enters the URL `https://markdarshan.vercel.app/api`, seemingly substituting the "your-app" placeholder with "markdarshan". Immediately below the URL entry, the error message "TypeError: Failed to fetch" is displayed. This suggests a possible issue with the URL provided, preventing the application from fetching data or resources from that endpoint, and points to a student troubleshooting scenario., **[Discussion Image by 22f3001315]** This image shows a student question and a subsequent error in the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion thread. The student is trying to determine the correct Vercel URL format, referencing the example `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`. The student provides their own URL `https://markdarshan.vercel.app/api`, but encounters a `TypeError: Failed to fetch` error, suggesting a problem with network connectivity or the API endpoint itself. The red highlight on the URL input field further confirms that it is related to the "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error. This is likely a point of confusion for the student as they are unsure if the URL is formatted incorrectly or if there is a deeper issue with the deployment or API. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f3001315]** This image captures a student question and an associated error during the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion. The student asks "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api" implying a need to correctly configure or identify the deployed URL. The student then enters the URL "https://markdarshan.vercel.app/api" into a form field, which results in a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error, indicating a problem in retrieving data from the specified URL. The student is likely experiencing issues connecting to their deployed Vercel application's API endpoint. This suggests a potential problem with either the URL itself, the API's availability, or a network-related issue preventing the fetch request from succeeding. 2x" data-dominant-color="292A2E">Screenshot 2025-01-12 2239561674Ã—158 12.8 KB
