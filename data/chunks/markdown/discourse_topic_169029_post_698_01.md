Why am my I getting `GET` request to my api endpoint? It must be IITM’s http request because I have not shared it with anyone.

**[Discussion Image by 23f1001231]** This image shows a log output related to network requests, likely from the TDS solver project. It appears to represent either student debugging or an instructor example. The logs consist of "INFO" and "WARNING" entries, with the "INFO" logs showing various GET requests to different URLs and the status code "404 Not Found," indicating that the resources were not found. Several "WARNING" entries indicate "Invalid HTTP request received," suggesting issues with the format or structure of those requests. These log entries capture information about IP addresses, ports, HTTP methods, requested paths, and HTTP versions, along with error messages related to the status of the requests.tentially requiring troubleshooting of the HTTP request handling logic." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="xkTr4Mh0qYkWV1gmyDSwqsHYoYZ" width="388" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1001231]** This image depicts a log output, likely from a TDS solver project, showing network requests and responses. It indicates a discussion around debugging HTTP requests, as evidenced by the various "GET" requests to different resources, most of which result in "404 Not Found" errors. The log also includes "WARNING: Invalid HTTP request received" messages, suggesting malformed or unsupported requests. The log entries display IP addresses and ports, request methods and URIs, HTTP versions, and response codes, capturing the technical details of network communication issues encountered during the project's execution. The repeated errors suggest a potential problem with the server configuration or the client's request construction., **[Discussion Image by 23f1001231]** This image shows a snippet of a student's console output, likely from running their TDS (Traffic Data System) solver project, and indicates a peer discussion. The output consists of "INFO" and "WARNING" messages, many showing "404 Not Found" errors when trying to "GET" various resources via HTTP/1.1, including "/", "/login", "/favicon.ico", and sometimes specific paths like "/squid-internal-mgr/cachemgr.cgi." Some requests use "PRI %2A HTTP/2.0" which could indicate HTTP/2 connection attempts, while others trigger "Invalid HTTP request received" warnings. The IP addresses and port numbers preceding the requests suggest these are originating from different sources, and may relate to parsing and handling of web traffic within the TDS solver. Seeing these errors could indicate issues with the server configuration, incorrect URL parsing, or protocol incompatibility within the student's project. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1001231]** This image shows a log snippet from the TDS solver project, indicating a mix of successful and unsuccessful HTTP requests, which is likely from the students testing the tool. It shows a series of "INFO" messages that detail various GET requests to different URLs, including root paths ("/"), specific resources like "squid-internal-mgr/cachemgr.cgi", "login", and "favicon.ico", along with requests using "PRI %2A HTTP/2.0", and other URLs. Many of these requests result in a "404 Not Found" error, while others are marked with "WARNING: Invalid HTTP request received", revealing some potential server-side issues and misconfigured requests. This log data would be valuable for students to debug their code, understand the HTTP protocol, and refine their handling of various request types and error responses during the TDS solver project. 2x" data-dominant-color="2C2B3C">image804×1035 206 KB
