**[Discussion Image by Divya1]** This image shows a project description for "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent" within a "Tools in Data Science" course, likely from a student discussion thread. The project is due on February 15, 2025, and results will be announced on February 25, 2025, with a prompt to use the Discourse thread for questions. The background section introduces a scenario where students are part of the DataWorks Solutions operations team, aiming to automate routine tasks using a Large Language Model (LLM) to process unpredictable incoming data from various sources. The left navigation panel shows course modules, including "Tools in Data Science", "Development Tools", "Deployment Tools", "Large Language Models", and the active "Project 1" section with subsections like "Background", "Create an API", "Phase A: Handle Operations", "Phase B: Handle Business...", and "Deliverables", giving context for potential student questions about specific aspects of the project.edictable data from logs, ticket systems, and source code. The navigation pane on the left shows the structure of course materials, including sections like "Development Tools," "Deployment Tools," "Large Language Models," and the sub-sections of "Project 1," which are "Background", "Create an API," "Phase A: Handle Operations", "Phase B: Handle Business...", and "Deliverables". This suggests students are being provided background information and guidance on the phases of developing an LLM-based automation agent." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="l2tGyjPZGc4BeKrx2WotCt6x2fC" width="690" height="229" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Divya1]** This image represents the project instructions for "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent" within a "Tools in Data Science" course, specifically the "Background" section, available on the course navigation panel. The project is due on February 15, 2025, with results announced on February 25, 2025, and students are directed to a Discourse thread for questions. The background information states that students are joining DataWorks Solutions to automate routine tasks using an LLM within a CI pipeline due to the unpredictable nature of incoming data. The LLM will act as an intermediate transformer for data from sources like logs, ticket systems, and source code. The left navigation shows project subsections: Background, Create an API, Phase A (Handle Operations), Phase B (Handle Business), and Deliverables., **[Discussion Image by Divya1]** This image shows the project instructions for "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent" from the TDS (Tools in Data Science) course. The project is due on February 15, 2025, and results will be announced on February 25, 2025. The document outlines the project background, specifying the student's role in the operations team at DataWorks Solutions, where they'll use an LLM to automate routine tasks and integrate them into a CI pipeline. A navigation menu on the left side of the screen indicates that the student is currently viewing the "Background" section of Project 1, within the "Large Language Models" section of the course. The navigation menu also lists other project sections like "Create an API", "Phase A: Handle Operations", "Phase B: Handle Business", and "Deliverables". 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Divya1]** This image shows the "Background" section of the "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent" instructions in the "Tools in Data Science" course, part of a student discussion thread, likely posted by the instructor. The project is due on 15 Feb 2025 EOD IST, with results announced by 25 Feb 2025, and students are directed to the Discourse thread for questions. The background context describes the project scenario: students join the operations team at DataWorks Solutions and will use an LLM to automate routine tasks within a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to handle unpredictable incoming data from logs, ticket systems, source code, and surveys. Navigation is shown via the left sidebar with the user expanded "Project 1" to show its sub-sections like "Background", "Create an API", "Phase A: Handle Operations...", "Phase B: Handle Business...", and "Deliverables". 2x" data-dominant-color="F7F7F7">image1750×581 70.9 KB
