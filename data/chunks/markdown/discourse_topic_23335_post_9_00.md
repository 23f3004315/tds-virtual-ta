Adding to the discussion here, I’d also have to say it’s quite the same feeling for me. I got lost while going through the videos. At first, I thought it’s some issue with me, because of which, the video is making less meaning. Seems like, many have the same issues. As told by many here, I would also emphasize the need for more practice questions.
