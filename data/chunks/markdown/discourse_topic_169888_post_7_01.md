 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this?

**[Discussion Image by 23ds3000002]** This image depicts a student contribution to a TDS discussion thread about Data Visualization (GA7). It shows a snippet of data, likely extracted from a larger dataset. The data is organized in a spreadsheet-like format (possibly Google Sheets or Excel) with columns labeled A through J. It contains information related to PPI (Producer Price Index) industry data for pharmaceutical preparations. Two distinct categories of pharmaceutical preparations are shown: "Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations" and "Calcium channel blockers," both noted as "not seasonally adjusted." Each category includes metadata such as Series Title, Series ID, Seasonality, Survey Name, Measure Data, Industry, and Item, which the student may be analyzing or seeking clarification about for a data visualization task. The student may be inquiring about the best way to visualize the similarities or differences between these two pharmaceutical categories or seeking guidance on which data points are most relevant for their visualization.he raw data being explored or cleaned before visualization, showing initial steps taken by the student. The student might be trying to understand the data structure and prepare it for visualization." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="nLdsnng6F2WtgWgIwgXqkCfpz7w" width="690" height="325" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23ds3000002]** This image shows a snippet of an Excel spreadsheet within a discussion thread, likely as part of a data visualization assignment. The sheet contains data related to the PPI (Producer Price Index) for the pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing industry. Two sets of data are displayed: one for "Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations" and another for "Calcium channel blockers", both "not seasonally adjusted". The data includes fields like Series Title, Series ID, Seasonality, Survey Name, Measure Data Type, Industry, and Item. The student is potentially asking how to effectively visualize this type of data, or might be sharing the dataset itself for others to use in their visualizations., **[Discussion Image by 23ds3000002]** This image depicts a segment of a Google Sheets spreadsheet, likely shared in a TDS student discussion forum regarding the "GA7 - Data Visualisation" assignment. The spreadsheet contains metadata for PPI (Producer Price Index) industry data related to pharmaceutical preparations. It shows data for two categories: "Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations" and "Calcium channel blockers", both listed as "not seasonally adjusted." Key fields displayed include "Series Title," "Series ID," "Seasonality," "Survey Name," "Measure Data Type," "Industry," and "Item," providing context for the data intended for visualization. A student might be seeking assistance on how to effectively visualize this data or clarify the meaning of certain fields. The data is structured in a way that makes it easy to identify different attributes and components of the dataset, facilitating further exploration for visualization purposes. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23ds3000002]** This image depicts data loaded into a spreadsheet, likely Google Sheets or Excel, for the TDS discussion "GA7 - Data Visualisation". It appears to be raw PPI (Producer Price Index) data related to the pharmaceutical industry, specifically showcasing examples for "Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations" and "Calcium channel blockers," both "not seasonally adjusted." Each entry includes details like Series Title, Series ID (e.g., PCU3254123254127111), Seasonality, Survey Name (PPI Industry Data), Measure Data Type, Industry, and Item. The structure suggests the student might be preparing to visualize or analyze this data, likely as part of their GA7 assignment. This could be a point of discussion or question about how to best handle and visualize the data, potentially related to parsing the long descriptive titles or dealing with categorical variables. 2x" data-dominant-color="F4F4F5">image1393×657 67.8 KB
