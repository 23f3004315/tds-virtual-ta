## Data Aggregation in Excel

[**[Course Image: Data aggregation in Excel]** This image illustrates how to apply conditional formatting with color scales in Excel for data aggregation, specifically to highlight trends in a dataset of new COVID-19 cases. To begin, navigate to 'Conditional Formatting' and select 'Color Scales,' which will open the 'New Formatting Rule' window. Here, you choose the '3-Color Scale' format style, and can customize the colors for the lowest, midpoint, and highest values to visually represent data ranges. This technique allows for a quick visual analysis of data distribution; for example, the highest values can be set to red, and the lowest values to green.itional formatting in Excel with a 3-Color Scale to visually represent data aggregation. You can highlight trends and patterns in your data, like "new_cases" for Brazil over time, by applying color gradients based on cell values. To do this, select the data range, go to "Conditional Formatting," choose "Color Scales," and then "3-Color Scale." The dialog box allows you to set the minimum, midpoint, and maximum values and choose corresponding colors to represent the lowest, middle, and highest values in your dataset, respectively. This allows for quick identification of high and low aggregation values within your dataset, a common task when exploring trends in data. This technique addresses the common need to visualize data aggregations and summarize large datasets for insights.)](https://youtu.be/NkpT0dDU8Y4)

You'll learn data aggregation and visualization techniques in Excel, covering:

- **Data Cleanup**: Remove empty columns and rows with missing values.
- **Creating Excel Tables**: Convert raw data into tables for easier manipulation and formula application.
- **Date Manipulation**: Extract week, month, and year from date columns using Excel functions (WEEKNUM, TEXT).
- **Color Scales**: Apply color scales to visualize clusters and trends in data over time.
- **Pivot Tables**: Create pivot tables to aggregate data by location and date, summarizing values weekly and monthly.
- **Sparklines**: Use sparklines to visualize trends within pivot tables, making data patterns more apparent.
- **Data Bars**: Implement data bars for graphical illustrations of numerical columns, showing trends and waves.
