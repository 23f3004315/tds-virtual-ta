 mean the TAs are not addressing studentsâ€™ concerns?

I am encountering the following error while running my project with these LLM endpoints:

**https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions**
**https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings**

**[Discussion Image by 22f2001640]** This image shows a student's question within the TDS "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent - Discussion Thread" on February 2025. The student encountered an error message related to the API usage limit; specifically, the displayed JSON error states "API Error: 429" and details that the user exceeded their $2 limit for February 2025 by using $2.002295600000011. This indicates the student has likely surpassed their allocated API budget for the project. The error message also contains newline characters `\n` for formatting, which are part of the structured JSON response. This provides essential context for understanding the constraints and limitations of the LLM-based automation agent project and helps guide students in managing their API usage.t's usage on February 2025 exceeded the allowed limit of $2. This means the student's LLM calls cost more than the allocated amount for that period. The student likely needs to either reduce their usage, optimize their code to use the LLM more efficiently, or potentially request an increase to their usage quota from the instructor. The error also contains newline characters represented as "\n" which format the error message for better readability. This is clearly a student question about troubleshooting API limits reached during project development." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="h1TDysFxS8sSBnC3Yk9Z4t6w7u1" width="690" height="25" data-dominant-color="303030">
