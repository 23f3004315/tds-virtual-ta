**[Discussion Image by 23f2003751]** This image shows a file directory structure within a VS Code project, presumably related to the TDS "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent" discussion. The root directory, "TDS-Project-1," contains subdirectories like "tds-project-1", "app", and "data," along with files such as "datagen.py", "evaluate.py", "Dockerfile", "main.py", "function_tasks.py", and "task_to_embed.txt." Notably, both "datagen.py" and "evaluate.py" show flags indicating changes or updates ("2, U" and "3, U" respectively), likely tracked by a version control system such as Git. The file structure shown may be relevant to a student question about project organization, dependencies, or modification tracking during the LLM project development.ted "tds-project-1" directory containing the "app" directory. Inside "app," there's a "data" directory along with Python files such as "__init__.py," "funtion_tasks.py," and "main.py," and a text file named "task_to_embed.txt." Also included are project-level files like ".gitignore," "datagen.py," "Dockerfile," "evaluate.py," and "README.md," plus a "LICENSE" file, suggesting a structured Python project layout with associated configuration and documentation files. The "2, U" and "3, U" next to "datagen.py" and "evaluate.py," respectively, likely indicate git status flags (number of changes, and untracked status)." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="tsLEGAhu1G9Q8fvPNw92H8Prfrp" width="237" height="500" data-dominant-color="2C2D2C">image266Ã—559 12.5 KB
