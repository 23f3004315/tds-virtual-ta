**[Discussion Image by karthiksirimilla]** This image shows an automated email response to a student submission for TDS Project 1, indicating a FAIL status due to a missing Dockerfile in the root of the GitHub repository. The email outlines the project prerequisites, including having a public GitHub repository, an MIT license, a valid Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image that runs via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`, confirming that the Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository. The email shows the results of prerequisite checks: Docker image and GitHub repo are PASS, but Dockerfile presence is FAIL, as is overall project prerequisites, resulting in a project score of 0. The student is being alerted that their submission will not be evaluated further unless these prerequisites are met. The core issue highlighted is the absence of a Dockerfile in the expected location within the GitHub repository.b repository failed, resulting in an overall "FAIL" for prerequisites and a project score of 0, indicating the submission will not be evaluated further in its current state. The student must ensure a Dockerfile is located in the root directory of their GitHub repository to pass the prerequisite checks." alt="IMG_6417" data-base62-sha1="1uIRebCprKWS8VSClyptr3riMaG" width="230" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by karthiksirimilla]** The image shows an automated email detailing the Project 1 prerequisite checks and evaluation results. The email outlines five requirements for the project, including having a public GitHub repository, a LICENSE file, a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image runnable with `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`, and ensuring the Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository. The evaluation results show that the Docker image and GitHub repository passed the checks, but the Dockerfile was not found in the root of the GitHub repository, causing the prerequisites to fail and the Project 1 score to be 0. This indicates a potential issue with the file structure in the student's GitHub repository, which needs to be corrected by placing the Dockerfile in the correct location., **[Discussion Image by karthiksirimilla]** This image shows an automated email sent to a student regarding their Project 1 prerequisite evaluations, indicating the start of a peer discussion to address the resulting issues. The email lists the prerequisites, which include having a public GitHub repository, a LICENSE file, a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image that runs with a specific podman command, and matching Dockerfiles in the image and repo. The student's evaluation results show that the Docker image and GitHub repository are present and public, and the MIT license is present, but the Dockerfile is not found in the root of the GitHub repository, causing the prerequisites to fail and resulting in a project score of 0. The email serves as an automated instructor feedback that the student failed to meet a basic project requirement and provides specific details of the failed check to guide correction. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by karthiksirimilla]** This image shows an instructor email detailing the prerequisites for Project 1, including having a public GitHub repository and Docker image, a LICENSE file, and a valid Dockerfile. The email also provides a `podman run` command example: `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`. The email further includes an evaluation of the student's submission, indicating that while the Docker image and GitHub repo are present and public, and the MIT license is present, the Dockerfile is not found in the root of the GitHub repository, leading to a "FAIL" and a project score of 0. This email is a notification to the student, indicating the cause of the failed prerequisites for Project 1. The main point of confusion is that the Dockerfile is not found in the root of the GitHub repository. 2x" data-dominant-color="2F3033">IMG_64171290Ã—2796 305 KB
