The API key is available at https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/

The instructions on how to use the token is given at GitHub - sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs

You cannot use this token directly with Open AI or any other gpt. These are only valid via the API exposed by the above instructions.

You get a limit of $1. Use with care.

Kind regards
