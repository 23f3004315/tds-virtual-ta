**[Discussion Image by 23f2005141]** The image shows the student's "Recent saves" section of the programming quiz in the student dashboard. The student, logged in as 23f2005141@ds.study.iitm.ac.in, has multiple saved attempts for the quiz, each with a corresponding timestamp and score of 6. Each saved attempt has a "Reload" button next to the timestamp. The dashboard indicates that the most recent save is the official score. The student's quiz score of 6 may be the source of their confusion in the discussion thread.logged in as 23f2005141@ds.study.iitm.ac.in, has multiple saves recorded, each with a "Reload" button and a timestamp. Each saved attempt on March 2nd, 2025, at 1:45:33 PM, 1:46:11 PM, and 1:51:06 PM resulted in a score of 6. The interface indicates that the most recent save represents the student's official score. The student is likely trying to understand how the displayed scores relate to the expected ROE score and whether "absent or incorrect" labels are being applied properly." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="3gt0tcQ5KtjywGAdqPzBrJuYXu0" width="475" height="307">image475Ã—307 8.78 KB
