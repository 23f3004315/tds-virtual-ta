**[Discussion Image by 23f2003717]** This image shows a question from the TDS Jan 2025 GA4 course about markdown content from a PDF formatted with prettier@3.4.2. The user is prompted to enter the correct markdown from the PDF. The answer is displayed in a text entry box: `|adficio|chirographum|`, `|---|---|`, `|vitae|ipsam|`, `|spectaculum|claudeo|`, `|comes|celebrer|`, followed by `Decumbo decumbo suadeo totidem apto.` The system marks this attempt as "Correct" and provides feedback stating that generating correct markdown from PDFs is difficult and usually requires manual corrections, but the question only checks a few basic things for simplicity.such as "|adficio|chirographum|", "|---|---|", "|vitae|ipsam|", and "Decumbo decumbo suadeo totidem apto.". The interface indicates the answer was correct with a green check mark and the label "Correct". The instructor then added a note stating that generating correct Markdown from PDFs is generally very hard and that manual corrections are usually required, further clarifying that this specific question simplifies the problem by checking only a few basic aspects." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="9jmVmFpAl64ITzi7mPWcu1sFF8B" width="636" height="500" data-dominant-color="282D31">image657Ã—516 26.1 KB
