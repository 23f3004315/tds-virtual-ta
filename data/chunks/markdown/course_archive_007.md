## Image labelling with chess pieces

[**[Course Image: Image labelling with chess pieces]** The image displays a directory structure in a file explorer, specifically showcasing an organized image dataset of chess pieces. The path "This PC > Desktop > ITIM_Online > Image_Classification > Input > Chessman-image-dataset > Chess > Bishop" indicates a structured approach to image classification, where images of 'Bishop' chess pieces are categorized within a broader 'Chessman' dataset. This organization is important for archiving and accessing specific image types efficiently. The naming convention of the images, such as "00000000.jpg" to "00000193.jpg", suggests a systematic way to archive and label the images, which is critical for tasks like machine learning where properly labeled and organized data is a prerequisite. Students can apply this structured approach to organize their own image datasets in TDS projects.ation of an image dataset for chess pieces, specifically focusing on the "Bishop" category, showing multiple images of bishop chess pieces stored as individual files, each labelled with a unique numerical identifier. The data is organized within a directory structure: `Desktop > ITIM_Online > Image_Classification > Input > Chessman-image-dataset > Chess > Bishop`. This file system view highlights the way image data is typically structured for machine learning tasks, particularly in image classification problems, where each class (chess piece type) has its own dedicated folder containing numerous example images. This organized dataset is essential for training a model to accurately identify and classify different chess pieces from images, which may later need to be archived. The context of this image is related to creating a structured image archive.)](https://youtu.be/OTRamjRb7P4)
