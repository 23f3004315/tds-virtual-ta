Reason: Poor spelling and unclear instructions.)
- **GOOD**: _Explain what a wireless network does. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation._ (Reason: Proper spelling and clarity lead to a more coherent response.)

> If your question sounds like gibberish, expect a messy answer. Speak cleanly.
> When you do, the response will be much clearer.

Watch [Prompt Engineering Tutorial – Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses (41 min)](https://youtu.be/_ZvnD73m40o). It covers:

1. Basics of **AI and large language models**.
2. How to write clear and detailed prompts to improve answers.
3. Tips for creating interactive and personalized AI responses.
4. Advanced topics like **AI mistakes** (hallucinations) and **text embeddings** (how AI understands words).
5. Fun examples, like making AI write poems or correct grammar.

[**[Course Image: Prompt Engineering Tutorial – Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses]** "Prompt Engineering" is a crucial skill for effectively interacting with AI models, as highlighted in the presented course material. This involves crafting precise and well-structured prompts to guide the AI towards generating desired outputs. The full course covers various aspects of prompt engineering, potentially including techniques for improving AI responses and ensuring accuracy. Furthermore, based on the code snippets visible, it appears the course may also touch on software development aspects relevant to AI integration, using tools and configurations associated with frameworks like Rails. Students can apply these prompt-engineering skills to various TDS projects that require interaction with LLMs.gineering Full Course," designed to help you master the art of crafting effective prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The course likely covers techniques for eliciting desired responses, refining prompts for clarity, and understanding the nuances of LLM behavior. Mastering prompt engineering is crucial for controlling and optimizing LLM outputs in various applications, whether you're writing poems or correcting grammar. The code on the left suggests the course might use a Ruby programming environment and testing framework. By the end of the course, you should be able to design prompts that consistently achieve specific goals and mitigate unwanted outputs from LLMs.)](https://youtu.be/_ZvnD73m40o)
