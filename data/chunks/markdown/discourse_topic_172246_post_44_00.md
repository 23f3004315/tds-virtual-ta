Thank you for taking the time to respond in detail. I’d like to respectfully share a few clarifications in response to some of the points raised.

When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence?

With due respect sir, I want to clarify that in my original message, I stated:

*“I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible…I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.”*

As mentioned above, my intention was never to express **jealousy**. It was simply an enquiry for clarity, especially around the communication and criteria related to the bonus system. The assumption that those who did not attempt GA7 chose not to put in effort is not accurate, respectfully.

You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all.
