I purely understand that the content solely belongs to IITM and I truly adhere to it.

Embeddings may allow others to monetise content without the appropriate permissions.

I can’t personally think of any way one can do this, but it’s completely upto to the operations team.

I ask for this permission as youtube can be quite distracting and getting rid of advertisements either require an adblocker that cause some trouble once in 2 weeks, even though they don’t turn of recommendations and hence the procrastination. Embedding is another way which can stop the recommendations and the advertisements.

Hope to hear soon,

Regards
