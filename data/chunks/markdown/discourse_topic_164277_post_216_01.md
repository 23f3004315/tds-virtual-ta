**[Discussion Image by vikramjncasr]** This image depicts a student question in the TDS Project 1 discussion, specifically an error encountered while running the automation agent. The student, vikramjncasr, attempts to run a container using the command `podman run 20511982f949`. This results in a traceback originating from `/app/app.py`, indicating a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`. The error suggests that the `fastapi` Python package is not installed within the container environment, causing the application to fail during the import statement. To resolve this, the student needs to install the `fastapi` package inside the container, likely using `pip install fastapi` or a similar package manager command, or rebuild the image after adding the dependency to the requirements.txt file. This indicates a common dependency management issue faced during containerized application development.in `/app/app.py` on the line `import fastapi`, meaning the `fastapi` Python package is not installed within the container environment. The student executed the command `podman run 20511982f949` from the `/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project` directory. This reveals a dependency issue where the required `fastapi` library is missing from the container. To resolve this, the student needs to ensure that the `fastapi` package is included in the container's build process or installed before running the application, potentially using `pip install fastapi` within the container." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="xRq27aO3iKC8e2tH9JXnzpGWF0T" width="690" height="129" data-dominant-color="222425">image1014Ã—190 18.2 KB
