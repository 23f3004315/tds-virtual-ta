Dear Shahzada,

You joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post)

The first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you.

What is this going on? Is it joking?

I am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions.

Our teachers donâ€™t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do?

We have made **several hours of videos** on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself.
