**[Discussion Image by Yogesh1]** This image shows the "Recent saves" section of an assignment submission, indicating that the student has saved their work multiple times. It displays a list of saved versions, each with a "Reload" button, a timestamp, and a score associated with that version. The most recent save is from 27/1/2025 at 1:14:12 pm with a score of 8.5, while older saves are from 22/1/2025 at 8:14:11 pm and 8:11:48 pm, both with a score of 7.25. This indicates the student likely improved their assignment over time, resulting in a higher score on the most recent save. Given this context, the student is likely seeing saved versions of their assignment with corresponding scores. The student posted this as part of an ongoing submission issue, likely to ask why the most recent submission isn't being recognized. "from 27/1/2025, 1:14:12 pm. Score: 8.5" and "from 22/1/2025, 8:14:11 pm. Score: 7.25". Each save has a "Reload" button, likely allowing the student to revert to a previous version. The presence of scores indicates that the assignment is automatically graded, and the saves represent different stages of completion. This is part of troubleshooting why a student's final submission is not shown; they're likely verifying that their most recent save with the best score was submitted. The student might be confused if they submitted the version with the highest score, but it's not reflected as their submitted assignment." alt="Capture" data-base62-sha1="mlm8UX7qD18XXPinIerdLrpmXr" width="690" height="110" data-dominant-color="D5E8E0">Capture1348Ã—216 3.75 KB
