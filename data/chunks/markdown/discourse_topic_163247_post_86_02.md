**[Discussion Image by Sudhishnarayan]** This image shows a student's question regarding the API URL endpoint for their implementation, with a provided example of "http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute". Below the input field containing "http://127.0.0.1:8001/execute", an error message "TypeError: Failed to fetch" is displayed, suggesting the student encountered a network-related problem when attempting to access this endpoint. The endpoint is highlighted in red, indicating a potential UI element feedback to the user about the error. This suggests that there's a problem with the provided URL preventing a successful connection, possibly due to an incorrect port number or an unavailable service at the given address.der around the input box signals an error validation, suggesting that the API URL provided may not be valid or reachable. The error suggests a problem with the client-side code's ability to reach the server, rather than an issue with the API itself." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-04 231847" data-base62-sha1="acDKMadQAHeWlJiLew1ahrHODt3" width="690" height="55" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Sudhishnarayan]** This image captures a student's question about the API URL endpoint for their implementation, with the instructor providing an example like "http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute". The student then inputs "http://127.0.0.1:8001/execute" into a URL input field, but the UI displays a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" message. The input field's red border indicates an error state, likely caused by the entered URL being unreachable or incorrectly configured. The error prevents the student from successfully connecting to the API endpoint, suggesting a need to troubleshoot network connectivity or the URL's correctness. Further debugging may require checking the server's status, CORS settings, or the validity of the endpoint., **[Discussion Image by Sudhishnarayan]** This image captures a student's question regarding the correct API URL endpoint for their implementation, potentially seeking guidance from an instructor or peers. The student inputs the URL `http://127.0.0.1:8001/execute`, but this results in the error message "TypeError: Failed to fetch". The instructor's prompt included the example URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute` which may be the intended endpoint or a variation is needed. This indicates a potential issue with either the URL itself, the server not running on the specified port, or a network connectivity problem preventing the fetch operation. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Sudhishnarayan]** This image shows a student's question about the API URL endpoint for their implementation, with a provided example of what it might look like: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`. The student entered `http://127.0.0.1:8001/execute` in an input box, but is encountering a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error, indicating a problem with the network request to the specified URL, likely meaning that the server is not running on port 8001, or the endpoint '/execute' is unavailable. The input box has a red border, visually indicating that the entered URL has a problem. The issue is the URL being attempted does not work and results in a "Failed to fetch" error. 2x" data-dominant-color="2D2B30">Screenshot 2025-02-04 2318471608×129 9.97 KB
