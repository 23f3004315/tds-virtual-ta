**[Discussion Image by trebhuvansb]** This image shows two questions, labeled Q1 and Q2, related to patents, likely part of a homework assignment or exam. Q1 asks the student to identify patents with the most claims from a given dataset, providing a specific patent ID "US20230225250A1-20230720" as sample data and an explanation about file parameter format. It instructs the student to cite the patent ID and list all patents with the same highest number of claims separated by commas without spaces. Both questions have a "Start coding or generate with AI" link indicating coding or AI tool usage is expected for answering.image" data-base62-sha1="luRRqNhEbn63U2Oxp1ZErgcS5ZZ" width="690" height="391" srcset="**[Discussion Image by trebhuvansb]** This image shows a student's view of patent questions posted during a TDS discussion forum. Question Q1 asks to identify the patent(s) with the highest number of claims from a given dataset, citing the patent ID; multiple patents with the same number of claims should be listed separated by commas without spaces, with the parameter file assumed to be the Patent ID. For example, the data Patent ID given is US20230225250A1-20230720. Question Q2 follows, with both questions having options to "Start coding" or "generate with AI." This format is likely part of a mock Rule of Engagement (ROE) exercise for a January 2025 TDS class., **[Discussion Image by trebhuvansb]** This image depicts part of a TDS student discussion, specifically presenting "Mock ROE" (Rules of Engagement) problems. It showcases two patent-related questions, Q1 and Q2, posed to the students, which appears to be instructor-provided content as part of an assignment or practice exercise. Q1 instructs the students to identify the patent(s) with the highest number of claims, given a dataset, and to cite the patent ID, following specific formatting instructions if multiple patents have the same number of claims. For Q1, a sample Patent ID US20230225250A1-20230720 is provided. For both questions, students are prompted to "Start coding or generate with AI", suggesting the use of programming or AI tools to solve the problem. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by trebhuvansb]** This image shows a student's view of the first two questions for the "Mock ROE 1, 2, 3, 4 [TDS Jan 2025]" assignment. Q1 asks: "Given a dataset, which patent(s) have the highest number of claims? Cite the patent ID. If you have multiple patents with the same number of claims, list them all separated by commas without spaces. The parameter file without the extension is assumed as the Patent ID.E.g. For the below data Patent ID is US20230225250A1-20230720". Q2 provides no instructions and simply states "Start coding or generate with AI." Each question prompts the student to either "Start coding" or "generate with AI", giving them options for approaching the problem. This suggests a student-facing exercise, likely a graded assignment to test understanding of the coursework. 2x" data-dominant-color="F2F3F3">image1284Ã—729 51.3 KB
