 this course a lot more important - the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense. Thanks to @s.anand and the entire course team who designed this amazing course

I hope ChatGPT solves deployment next

**[Discussion Image by gshetty]** This image shows a discussion between a student and ChatGPT while developing a "Wiki Outline Api" in Python. The code attempts to fetch and parse Wikipedia pages to generate a Markdown outline, using libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. The student initially encountered a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ssl'` issue. In response, ChatGPT updated the code to handle environments without SSL by incorporating `certifi` and checking the `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` environment variable as a workaround; this addresses the SSL configuration. The console output, however, indicates a different set of issues related to `starlette` and `anyio`, which is a dependency problem, but then at the bottom it says, "Run successfully."utput indicates "Run successfully" which suggests the updated code is functioning as intended after the SSL workaround, despite earlier error messages." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-07 at 7.08.14 PM" data-base62-sha1="1CfSAvIR3jjnJISxAXFo1jbkZqO" width="690" height="363" srcset="**[Discussion Image by gshetty]** This image depicts a discussion with ChatGPT in which the bot provides code to fetch and outline a Wikipedia page, but the code initially encounters a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ssl'` issue. ChatGPT addresses this error by modifying the code to handle environments without SSL by incorporating a workaround that uses `certifi` and checks the `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` environment variable. The provided code snippet includes functions to fetch the Wikipedia page, parse HTML content using BeautifulSoup, and extract headings. The console output shows the stack trace of the error and finally shows "Run successfully" after the suggested fix. The response indicates this is an iterative refinement process with the student prompting the AI for solutions., **[Discussion Image by gshetty]** This image shows a conversation with ChatGPT and a code editor, troubleshooting an SSL-related issue in a Python application. Initially, the code produced a "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ssl'" error, indicating a problem with SSL support. ChatGPT provided an updated code version that includes a workaround using 'certifi' and checks the 'PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY' environment variable to handle environments without SSL, attempting to resolve the import error. However, the console output reveals further errors originating from starlette and anyio packages, specifically related to attempting to import "ssl" in "/lib/python3.12/site-packages/anyio/_core/_sockets.py". This indicates the workaround was not fully successful and the SSL dependency issue persists downstream. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by gshetty]** This image depicts a discussion between a student and ChatGPT about a Python code snippet designed to fetch Wikipedia pages and generate a Markdown outline. The student initially encountered a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ssl'` issue. ChatGPT responded by updating the code to handle environments without SSL, including a workaround that uses `certifi` and checks the `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` environment variable. The provided code includes functions to format the Wikipedia URL, fetch the page content, parse the HTML using BeautifulSoup, and extract headings (H1 to H6), and the console output shows the traceback indicating the missing 'ssl' module, but ultimately says "Run successfully" at the bottom. 2x" data-dominant-color="323332">Screenshot 2025-02-07 at 7.08.14 PM1920Ã—1012 120 KB
