**[Discussion Image by 23f2004912]** This image shows the terminal output of the TDS server during the Project 2 discussion. The log entries show the server receiving "POST /api HTTP/1.0" requests, along with a "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.0" request, all returning a "200 OK" status, indicating successful handling of the requests. The timestamp and process ID for the TDS server are also displayed, along with the IP address 103.158.43.17:0 as the client making the requests. The presence of multiple "POST /api" requests suggests potential interaction or testing with the API endpoint. The prompt "azureuser@TDS:~$" indicates the user's current directory in the TDS environment.` at `Apr 06 11:08:19`. Each POST request reports an HTTP status code of "200 OK," meaning they were successfully processed by the server. The IP address `103.158.43.17:0` is logged as the origin of each request. The prompt `azureuser@TDS:~$` suggests this output is captured from an Azure environment." alt="Screenshot 2025-04-06 170305" data-base62-sha1="2QHv4LuZNtGBr82CbEdgWrJU6FE" width="689" height="96" data-dominant-color="232020">Screenshot 2025-04-06 1703051231Ã—173 5.14 KB
