## Geospatial Analysis with Excel

[**[Course Image: Geospatial analysis with Excel]** This image visualizes geospatial data using Excel, specifically showing a 3D map of New York City with bar graphs representing data values at different locations. This technique allows for representing data insights geographically, turning raw data into visually interpretable patterns. The height and color of each bar correspond to a data point or calculated metric associated with that geographic area, for instance, green bars might represent lower values and yellow bars higher values of a given variable. This visualization enables viewers to quickly identify areas of high and low concentration of whatever data is being measured (e.g., population density, sales revenue). Analyzing geospatial data in Excel empowers students to map data, analyze geographic relationships, and create visually compelling data stories. Mastering these skills enables users to derive meaningful insights and make informed decisions based on location-based data. analysis in Excel, specifically using 3D maps to visualize data across a geographical area. The map shows the island of Manhattan overlaid with vertical bars of varying heights and colors (green and gold), representing data values associated with different locations. This visualization technique allows for easy identification of areas with high or low values, helping to reveal spatial patterns. By using 3D maps in Excel, users can gain insights into geographic distributions and correlations within their datasets. This approach is useful for various applications, such as identifying areas of high customer density, visualizing sales performance by region, or analyzing demographic data.)](https://youtu.be/49LjxNvxyVs)

You'll learn how to create a data-driven story about coffee shop coverage in Manhattan, covering:

- **Data Collection**: Collect and scrape data for coffee shop locations and census population from various sources.
- **Data Processing**: Use Python libraries like geopandas for merging population data with geographic maps.
- **Map Creation**: Generate coverage maps using tools like QGIS and Excel to visualize coffee shop distribution and population impact.
- **Visualization**: Create physical, Power BI, and video visualizations to present the data effectively.
- **Storytelling**: Craft a narrative around coffee shop competition, including strategic insights and potential market changes.
