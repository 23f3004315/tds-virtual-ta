## Data Analysis with SQL

[**[Course Image: Data Analysis with Databases]** This image displays data from the Relational Dataset Repository, used for data analysis with SQL, showcasing datasets with varying algorithms applied to a specific target variable. The dataset versions ("stats") have "Reputation" as the target. The algorithms employed include "FastProp", "Relboost", and "Deep Feature Synthesis", providing different approaches to model the "Reputation" target. The "Author text" column indicates the origin or method, such as "getML: Feature Learning with AutoML" or "featuretools," revealing potential external libraries or frameworks used in the data analysis process. This demonstrates how different algorithms can be applied and compared within a SQL-driven data analysis workflow to achieve predictive modeling or insightful analysis of relational data. By exploring datasets with various algorithms, data scientists can choose the most suitable approach for their specific analysis goals and improve model performance. dataset repository listing various machine-learning algorithms applied to predict a specific target. The dataset version being used is labeled as "stats," and the target variable is "Reputation." Algorithms like "FastProp," "Relboost," and "Deep Feature Synthesis" are shown as being used to model the "Reputation" target. The "Author text" column indicates the origin of the algorithm, referring to "getML: Feature Learning with AutoML to build end-to-end prediction" or "featuretools." By exploring this repository, data analysts can identify suitable datasets and algorithms for their predictive modeling tasks. This helps in understanding how different algorithms perform when applied to relational data, enabling data-driven decision-making.)](https://youtu.be/Xn3QkYrThbI)
