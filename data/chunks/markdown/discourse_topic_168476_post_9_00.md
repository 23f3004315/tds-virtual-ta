Thank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.

Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the **grading pattern will not be changed**. And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.

TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:

[Quote]: 
**This course is quite hard**

Here’s students’ feedback:

It *used* to be an easy course until 2024. # # #
Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # #
Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # #
LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # #
The ROE is hard. #
