The student's "Your Score" is blank, while the "Peer Average" is 99% and the "Median Score" is 100, suggesting that the student has not yet completed the assignment. The student is logged in as "22f3001740@ds.study.iitm.ac.in", with a "Logout" button visible. The "Recent saves" section shows three entries, each with a "Reload" button, indicating that the student has made multiple saves around 9:32-9:33 PM on January 23, 2025, and each save received a "Score: 8," implying this is likely an interactive assessment.

The "Recent saves" section shows multiple attempts on January 23, 2025 around 9:32-9:33 PM, each yielding a "Score: 8", with a "Reload" button to presumably revert to those save states, implying the student might be troubleshooting how to submit or obtain a better score.
