**[Discussion Image by 22f2000526]** This image shows the Swagger UI for a FastAPI application, indicating a troubleshooting discussion in the TDS student project. The UI, accessed via `127.0.0.1:8000/docs/`, displays API endpoints including GET requests for `/ask` and `/read` and a POST request for `/run`. Below the endpoint list, the UI shows sections for "Schemas", indicating `HTTPValidationError` and `ValidationError` objects, which might suggest issues with data validation in the API. The collapsible structure of the UI allows users to expand these schemas to view specific error details. It is most likely a student has encountered validation errors, so they included this screenshot in a discussion to seek help.ssion. The errors appear to be related to the schemas used in the API definition, which needs further debugging for clarification." alt="Screenshot 2025-04-07 192419" data-base62-sha1="46C14tdqZzBLJXFGMHfybZu3hK8" width="690" height="341" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f2000526]** This image shows the FastAPI interactive API documentation generated at the URL 127.0.0.1:8000/docs, indicating a student is likely testing or debugging their API implementation as part of a project. The documentation displays three API endpoints: a GET request to "/ask", a POST request to "/run", and a GET request to "/read", all grouped under the "default" category. Below the endpoint definitions, there are two schema sections for "HTTPValidationError" and "ValidationError", both initially collapsed but with an "Expand all object" link, suggesting possible validation issues the student might be encountering. The presence of these validation errors indicates potential input data issues or problems with the API's data validation logic. This likely contributes to student confusion in the discussion, prompting them to seek assistance to resolve these validation errors., **[Discussion Image by 22f2000526]** This image depicts the FastAPI documentation page generated at the address `127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/`. The page shows the available API endpoints, including `GET /ask Ask`, `POST /run Run Task`, and `GET /read Read File`, each displayed in an expandable section. Below the endpoints, there is a "Schemas" section, collapsed by default, containing schemas for `HTTPValidationError` and `ValidationError`, both indicated as objects. The presence of the documentation page suggests a student might be exploring or debugging their FastAPI application, potentially examining the expected request and response formats or available endpoints. The student can expand these to get a more detailed specification of the API. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f2000526]** This image shows a screenshot of the FastAPI documentation interface at `127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/`. The documentation displays the available API endpoints, which include GET requests for `/ask` (Ask) and `/read` (Read File), and a POST request for `/run` (Run Task), each within expandable sections. At the bottom, the "Schemas" section is visible, indicating potential data structures, including `HTTPValidationError` and `ValidationError`, both marked as objects with an "Expand all" option. The student is likely examining this documentation to understand the structure and available functionalities of the FastAPI application, potentially troubleshooting validation errors by examining the schema definitions. The presence of validation errors suggests a problem related to data input or output during API calls. This documentation provides insight into the project's API structure and potential error types. 2x" data-dominant-color="F6F9FA">Screenshot 2025-04-07 1924191534×760 38 KB
