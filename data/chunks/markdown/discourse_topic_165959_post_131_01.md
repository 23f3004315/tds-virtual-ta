**[Discussion Image by 23f2004941]** This image depicts a student question in the TDS Jan 2025 GA4 discussion. The top portion displays the expected JSON output format for a weather forecast, showing date keys with corresponding weather descriptions (e.g., `"2025-01-01": "Sunny with scattered clouds"`). The student attempts to provide a JSON response for the "What is the JSON weather forecast description for Shanghai?" prompt, entering multiple date-weather pairs. However, the "Check" button submission results in an error: "Error: At root: Different number of properties," indicating a mismatch between the expected and provided structure. The student's JSON includes `"2025-02-07": "A clear sky and a moderate breeze"` format for consecutive dates, but the error suggests the system expects a single property or potentially a different data structure.sn't align with the validation criteria, likely related to an expected number of days or properties in the weather forecast JSON. The student needs to adjust the forecast dates or the number of properties provided to match the exercise's requirements for a successful validation." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="hYjLSQjYoGqUFsrJfPCj88YeyCk" width="690" height="302" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2004941]** This image shows a student attempt to answer a question in a TDS course, likely involving JSON data for a GA4 project. The student is tasked with providing a JSON weather forecast description for Shanghai, following a given output format example. The student's provided JSON includes date strings as keys and weather descriptions as values for multiple days. However, the "Check" button triggers an error: "Error: At root: Different number of properties," indicating that the JSON structure may not be what the checker expects, specifically regarding the number of root properties. The student is likely confused about the required format, potentially needing clarification on expected keys or number of entries within the JSON., **[Discussion Image by 23f2004941]** This image captures a student's attempt to answer a question about a JSON weather forecast, showcasing a peer discussion on the TDS platform. The prompt asks "What is the JSON weather forecast description for Shanghai?" after an example is shown with date strings as keys and weather descriptions as values. The student's answer includes similar key-value pairs representing dates and weather conditions, but the "Check" button reveals the error "Error: At root: Different number of properties". It appears that the number of properties (key-value pairs) in the provided JSON does not match the expected solution, suggesting that the student needs to either add or remove entries from their JSON input to match the expected length. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2004941]** This image depicts a student submission and the resulting error in a "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread". The student is prompted to provide a JSON weather forecast description for Shanghai, and a sample JSON structure is provided as an example with date keys and weather description values. The student's attempt includes several date/weather pairs, but upon submission, the system returns an error: "Error: At root: Different number of properties," indicating a mismatch in the expected data structure or format compared to the example, potentially related to the number of entries. The student likely needs to revise their JSON structure to align with the specified requirements of the assignment, paying close attention to the data structure in the given example. 2x" data-dominant-color="202429">image1746Ã—766 56.3 KB
