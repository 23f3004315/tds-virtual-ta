**[Discussion Image by Saransh_Saini]** This image depicts a student encountering a JSON parsing error within the TDS project discussion. The code snippet shows a "Sorted JSON" output that is flagged with a "SyntaxError: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 16 (line 1 column 17)". The problematic JSON structure contains an array of objects representing individuals with "name" and "age" properties, but the error arises likely due to an incomplete or malformed JSON entry, as the last object only contains the letter 'r'. This indicates a student question regarding JSON formatting and troubleshooting, potentially a cut-off in the JSON or an unclosed curly bracket, causing a syntax error when parsing. The student will need to identify what valid JSON should be present instead of 'r'.SON array containing objects with "name" and "age" properties, but a `SyntaxError: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 16 (line 1 column 17)` is reported. The JSON shows the names "Bob", "Emma", and "Grace" with their respective ages but also a JSON with only "r" which caused the error. The error highlights a malformed JSON structure, likely due to an incomplete or incorrect property definition. It points to issues in the structure or parsing logic when converting data into JSON format and shows the point of interruption as the malformed "{ \"r" object. This could be a parsing error, string conversion error, or issue in the logic creating the JSON objects and shows that the student is facing issues with correctly formatted JSON." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="to6RkJSBpr1SizkEA8isZyc3TOM" width="690" height="76" data-dominant-color="2A2B2F">image1107Ã—122 4.01 KB
