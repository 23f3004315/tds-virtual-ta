**[Discussion Image by 23f2000098]** This image depicts a student facing an error while attempting to use an API endpoint in the TDS Large Language Models discussion. The student inputs "http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute" as the API URL, but encounters a "SyntaxError: 'undefined' is not valid JSON" error, indicating a problem with the response format. The right panel shows a UI for testing the endpoint; the student is trying to query "What is the status of ticket 83742?" using a GET request with URL encoding, reflected in the Curl command `curl -X 'GET' 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute?q-What%20is%20the%20status%20of%20ticket%2083742?'-H 'accept: application/json'`. The prompt on the left mentions the importance of CORS and that the arguments must be in the same order as the function definition. The error is likely due to an invalid JSON response from the server despite the request being correctly formed, potentially due to missing data or incorrect server configuration.long with the generated Curl command and Request URL, indicating an attempt to construct and test the API call, likely revealing the URL encoding and parameters needed for the task. The task is titled "Get an LLM to say Yes (1 mark)", which implies the student is trying to get the LLM to produce an affirmative response." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="sxEKljVfQmjjBBfFv6mLN3RqeV9" width="690" height="304" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2000098]** This image captures a student's interaction with an online coding assignment, specifically related to calling an API endpoint. The student entered the API URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute` but receives a `SyntaxError: "undefined" is not valid JSON` error. The interface prompts the student to enable CORS and provides information on how the request will be tested using a GET request with a query parameter. On the right, the user interface displays the query parameter "q" with the value "What is the status of ticket 83742?" and the generated curl command and request URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute?q=What%20is%20the%20status%20of%20ticket%2083742?`, possibly to help the student debug the interaction with the API. The task requires the student to call the API and get an LLM to respond with "Yes"., **[Discussion Image by 23f2000098]** This image captures a student attempting to configure an API endpoint within the TDS Large Language Models course, specifically for the "get_ticket_status" function, according to post #106 of the discussion thread. The student is trying to define the API URL as `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute` but receives a `SyntaxError: "undefined" is not valid JSON`. The platform indicates that it will send a GET request to this URL with a query parameter `?q` containing the task and also asks them to enable CORS for GET requests. The right panel of the image shows the student attempting to execute a query to find the status of ticket 83742, and it generates a curl command and the request URL with the encoded query parameters, however, there's no information on the server response being displayed yet. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2000098]** This image shows a student's attempt to implement an API endpoint for retrieving ticket status and the associated troubleshooting process. The student is prompted to enter the API URL endpoint, and after entering "http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute," they receive a "SyntaxError: 'undefined' is not valid JSON" error, indicating a problem with the JSON structure or data being sent to the API. On the right side of the screen, the student is using a UI with a field labeled "q" to formulate a query string, aiming to ask "What is the status of ticket 83742?". The generated curl command and request URL expose the query string "q=What%20is%20the%20status%20of%20ticket%2083742%3F" which suggests that the problem might be related to the query string being passed in the URL or a lack of CORS configuration on the server. 2x" data-dominant-color="D2D5D9">image1287Ã—568 32 KB
