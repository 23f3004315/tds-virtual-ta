**[Discussion Image by 23f2000778]** This image shows the student's view of the online exam interface after the exam has ended at "Sun, 2 Mar, 2025, 1:45 pm IST" according to the red banner at the top, where the student's score is currently "0." The "Recent saves" section, highlighted in green, lists multiple save timestamps with a score of 10 each, accompanied by "Reload" buttons, indicating the system might be showing previous states of saved work. The text "(most recent is your official score)" implies the most recent save should be considered the final score, but the displayed score is inconsistent with the final score showing up as 0 at the top and multiple saves of 10 in the "Recent saves" section. This suggests a potential problem with the score calculation or display on the exam platform, specifically at the exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-roe URL. The student may be confused about which score is the accurate final score.01-roe`, ended on Sun, 2 Mar, 2025, at 1:45 pm IST. Although the top banner indicates a Score of 0, the "Recent saves" section displays three saves with a score of 10, dated 3/2/2025 at 1:41:33 PM and 1:41:37 PM, each with a "Reload" button. The note states "(most recent is your official score)". This inconsistency between the overall score and the recent saves suggests a potential display or calculation issue, prompting the student's confusion." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="bk2pKS8f3mLSF42Dvud0EovNIpn" width="618" height="500" data-dominant-color="4D4140">image633Ã—512 23.8 KB
