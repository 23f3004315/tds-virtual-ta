**[Discussion Image by 21f3002647]** The image shows a file directory structure for an LLM project, likely for a university or online course submission based on the related TDS forum post context. The directory includes a folder named "LLM_PROJECT1" alongside other common project files. The files present in the directory root include `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `requirements.txt`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`. A `__pycache__` folder is also visible, which is automatically generated by Python to store compiled bytecode. The user is demonstrating that a Dockerfile exists in the project root, contrary to receiving a "FAIL" mark potentially indicating its absence..py`, `requirements.txt`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`, along with a `__pycache__` folder. The student is likely facing issues with their project submission because, despite having a `Dockerfile`, it was marked as a failure, and this image helps to depict the project setup. The student may be seeking help from instructors or peers to understand why their project failed, given the presence of a Dockerfile. The file structure suggests a Python-based project with dependencies managed through `requirements.txt` and tasks split into multiple Python files." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="fahuMqTlIDS9GwNGNM399QrBKhJ" width="234" height="500" data-dominant-color="161A21">image250Ã—534 3.92 KB
