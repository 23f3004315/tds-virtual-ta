**[Discussion Image by 23f2004912]** The image shows a student's debugging process for the TDS project 1, specifically regarding the LLM-based Automation Agent. The student is likely trying to extract credit card numbers, and the IDE displays the file `credit_card.png` open along with the task files `taskA2.py`, `evaluate.py`, and `datagen.py`. In the terminal output, the expected output for `/data/credit-card.txt` (4390652220367260078) does not match the result (4390652220367260), indicated by "All Failed" and HTTP POST request failure with message "failed: 'data'", suggesting an issue with data extraction or API communication. The numbers "390 6622 2036 7260" are visible on the editor, potentially representing extracted credit card information or test data, with "VALID" and "HRU" nearby. The error indicates a possible mismatch between the format of the expected data and the actual data being sent.ately process and submit credit card data. The student likely needs to examine their data processing logic and data submission process to resolve the errors." alt="A8" data-base62-sha1="eSjyAinyD3Rk4efDQena0iYIpRF" width="281" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2004912]** This image depicts a student facing issues with "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent", specifically during the execution of `taskA2.py`, as indicated by the open files `taskA2.py`, `evaluate.py`, and `datagen.py` in the code editor. The left sidebar displays the file system, highlighting both `credit-card.png` and `credit-card.txt` within the 'data' directory. The terminal output shows errors when processing `/data/credit-card.txt`, including an "EXPECTED" value of "4390652220367260078" that differs from the "RESULT" received, "4390652220367200", leading to an "X All FAILED" message. Furthermore, a failing HTTP POST request to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev` indicates a problem with the 'data' being sent, suggesting a possible data format or content issue during the API call, which contributes to the overall test failure. It appears the student is struggling with data validation and API communication within their automation agent project., **[Discussion Image by 23f2004912]** This image captures a student's troubleshooting process during the TDS Project 1, focusing on an LLM-based automation agent, likely involving data extraction or manipulation. The screenshot of the IDE shows the student's file structure on the left, including Python scripts (taskA1.py, taskA2.py, etc.) and data files (credit_card.png, credit_card.txt). The main window displays the contents of "credit_card.png" (a series of numbers) and the "Terminal" output at the bottom reveals errors during the execution of the tasks. The error messages indicate discrepancies between expected and actual results when processing the data in "credit-card.txt", with "A8" and "A9" tests failing, the latter specifically due to an issue with 'data' during an HTTP POST request to a specified URL. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2004912]** This image captures a student's terminal output during the TDS "Project 1" discussion, specifically related to task evaluation. The student is encountering errors, as evidenced by the "PROBLEMS 3" notification in the lower panel. The terminal output shows that the student ran some tests that compare an expected result with an actual result from the file `/data/credit-card.txt`, and that the result does not match, and task A8 and A9 have failed. Additionally, it shows an HTTP request is being made to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev` which might be contributing to the issue. This suggests the student needs to debug their code to ensure the extracted credit card data matches the expected format and potentially investigate why the HTTP request is failing. 2x" data-dominant-color="446487">A8720Ã—1280 85.1 KB
