## Convert PDFs to Markdown

- [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/) is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction.
- [PyMuPDF4LLM](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pymupdf4llm/index.html) is apart of PyMuPDF that generates Markdown from PDFs that's suitable for LLMs.
- [unstructured](https://unstructured.io/) is radidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types and extracting text and tables. It's particularly useful for generating content to pass to LLMs.
