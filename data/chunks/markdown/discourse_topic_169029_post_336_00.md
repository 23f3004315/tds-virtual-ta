## Post #336 by 23f2005702

**Direct Link**: [Post #336](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/169029/336)

in spreadsheet edit response modify previous response with timestamp, how you can access that timestamp response?? So how can u have my end point before deadline one since i updated it after deadline.

Also the before deadline one end point is

/api which i changed to /api/ after deadline so if u somehow have access to my old url pls consider adding 1 (slash) / :')
