# Data Storytelling

[**[Course Image: Narrate a story]** In data storytelling, effectively narrating the story involves a balance of numbers, visuals, and text to convey insights. Analyzing a "Channel Banking Report for Sandra Miles, May 2016", one can observe how unique mobile banking users declined, causing concern, despite a competitive position among peers. The report shows that while SMS users increased, LiteSite and App users decreased, signaling potential areas for improvement. A good data story combines these elements to present a clear, understandable, and actionable narrative to the audience, going beyond simply presenting raw data. Effective data storytelling requires careful consideration of context and a focus on delivering key insights.y, consider structuring it with "Numbers," "Visuals," and explanatory "Text." The image presents a "Channel Banking Report" example, revealing insights such as a consecutive decline in unique mobile banking users, indicating a concern. The report further details performance metrics like SMS user increases versus LiteSite/App user decreases, demonstrating the importance of highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs). By combining quantitative data with narrative context, one can effectively communicate the significance of findings and potential areas for improvement. This approach ensures that data is not just presented but interpreted and understood within a broader business context.)](https://youtu.be/aF93i6zVVQg)
