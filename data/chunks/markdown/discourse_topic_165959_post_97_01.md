Q4 BBC Weather

I don’t understand why I am getting

[Quote]: 
Error: At root: Different number of properties

Is it because of different dates? Shall I match the dates?

@carlton Please guide. Thank you.

**[Discussion Image by Nelson]** This image captures a student's attempt to answer a coding task within the TDS Jan 2025 GA4 course, specifically related to data sourcing. The task involves using the BBC Weather API to retrieve weather data, extract `issueDate` and `enhancedWeatherDescription`, and transform the data into a specific JSON format. The student's attempt to provide the JSON weather forecast for Osaka results in an error: "Error: At root: Different number of properties". The expected output format includes a fixed number of entries whereas the student's input has a different number of date-weather description pairs, causing the "Different number of properties" validation error upon clicking the "Check" button. The provided JSON examples demonstrate the desired output structure, which the student needs to replicate more accurately for the given Osaka weather forecast data.cedWeatherDescription, and create a JSON output where the issueDate corresponds to the enhancedWeatherDescription. The provided example shows the desired JSON structure. The student is specifically asked to provide the JSON weather forecast description for Osaka, but their submission generates the error message: "Error: At root: Different number of properties." This indicates that the structure of their JSON output does not match the expected format; they included too many properties in their output compared to the expected outcome format in the example. The "Check" button suggests this is part of an interactive coding exercise with automated validation." alt="BBC weather" data-base62-sha1="x4caGkZQS7QFDr2zWd5BwnQipHV" width="361" height="500" data-dominant-color="292B31">BBC weather565×781 30.5 KB
