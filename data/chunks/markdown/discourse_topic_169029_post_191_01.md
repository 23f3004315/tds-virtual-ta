**[Discussion Image by 24f2006531]** This image depicts an instructor's or a tool's demonstration of how to use the `/api/uploadCsv` endpoint, showing the UI elements and a successful API call. The UI allows for specifying parameters such as 'class' (with values "1A" and "1B" as array strings) and selecting a CSV file named "fstops.csv" to upload via a 'multipart/form-data' request. After clicking "Execute", the interface shows the equivalent cURL command: `curl -X "POST" 'https://b3cc-223-178-84-140.ngrok-free.app/api?class=1A&class=1B' -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F 'file=@fstops.csv;type=text/csv'`. The server response includes a 200 OK status with a JSON response body containing an array of "students", each object having "studentId" and "class" fields; for example, `{"studentId": 233, "class": "1B"}` and `{"studentId": 344, "class": "1A"}`. This showcases a working API call and the structure of the expected response.onfirms the upload and filtering functionality worked as expected, returning only student IDs with classes of 1A and 1B as specified. The UI elements shown include parameters input, a file selection for CSV upload, and an execute button which enables triggering the API request directly from the web interface." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="8UHivpurj5Zx4XOtKwrtT3nPXPw" width="552" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 24f2006531]** This image shows an interaction with the /api endpoint to upload a CSV file and retrieve student data, as part of a peer discussion about the TDS solver project. The UI elements displayed include input fields for parameters like 'class' with values '1A' and an array string '1B'. The request body section indicates the requirement for a file upload using "multipart/form-data", with an option to choose a file named 'fostop1.csv'. Upon successful execution, the server returns a 200 OK response containing a JSON payload with a "students" array; each student has "studentId" and "class" attributes. This exchange may clarify how to interact with the API and interpret the returned student data based on class filters., **[Discussion Image by 24f2006531]** This image depicts a successful interaction with a `/api/Upload Csv` endpoint within a student project, demonstrating how to upload a CSV file and filter student data by class. The user interface shows parameters for filtering by class using query parameters, including "1A" and "1B." A CSV file named "q-fastapi.csv" is chosen as the input file. The execution results in a "200 OK" response, providing a JSON response body that contains a list of students filtered by class. The equivalent cURL command for this API call is also displayed for replication. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 24f2006531]** This image depicts a student interacting with the TDS Solver's API endpoint for uploading a CSV file and filtering student data by class. The student is using a POST request to the `/api/` endpoint, providing query parameters `class=1A` and `class=1B` to filter the results. They have selected the `q-fastapi.csv` file as the request body and set the content type to `multipart/form-data`. The server response shows a 200 OK status code, with a JSON response body containing an array of "students" objects, each including "studentId" and "class" fields, successfully filtered based on the provided query parameters. This suggests the student is successfully exploring the API's filtering capabilities via the query string. 2x" data-dominant-color="C3CAC7">image1932×1748 225 KB
