**[Discussion Image by atishaygarg]** This image captures a student's Project 1 prerequisite evaluation results, presented in a list format. The student has successfully passed the Docker image requirement but failed in several areas, namely Github repository presence and public visibility, the presence of a Dockerfile at the root of the Github repository, and the presence of an MIT license at the root of the Github repository. Because of these failures, the overall prerequisites and project 1 score show as 0. This indicates a need to troubleshoot the Github repository's public accessibility, the location of the Dockerfile, and the presence of the required license within the repository's root directory. The student needs to address these issues to meet the project requirements and achieve a passing grade.ker image presence and visibility, Github repo presence and public accessibility, Dockerfile presence in the repository root, and an MIT license in the repository root. The Docker image check passed, but the Github repo, Dockerfile, and MIT license checks all failed, leading to an overall "Prerequisites: FAIL" status and a Project 1 score of 0. This indicates the student is likely facing issues with Github repository setup, Dockerfile placement, or license file inclusion. The context suggests the student needs to ensure their Github repository is public and contains both a Dockerfile and an MIT license in the root directory." alt="2025-04-01_13:10:20" data-base62-sha1="cRQspPlKpiRwam8T7Vcbpu5YlhL" width="564" height="317">2025-04-01_13:10:20564Ã—317 12.3 KB
