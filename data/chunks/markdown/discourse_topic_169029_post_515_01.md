 of GET requets instead of POST in my logs file which was for the past couple of days requests, which is very unlikely . Please check my link again , its still active . App link - http://16.16.189.187:8000/tdsp2

**[Discussion Image by 23f1002574]** This image depicts a student's code and terminal output in the context of the TDS "Project 2 - TDS Solver" discussion. The student is using Python and the `requests` library to send a POST request to a FastAPI server. The request includes a question about calculating the total sales of "Gold" tickets, and also includes the file "q-fastapi.csv". The terminal output shows a successful HTTP status code (200) and the response JSON, which contains an SQL query to calculate the total sales. The SQL query selects the sum of (units * price) from the "tickets" table where the lowercase and trimmed "type" column equals "gold".ulate total sales for "Gold" ticket types. The generated SQL query `SELECT SUM(units * price) AS total_sales FROM tickets WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold';` correctly addresses the original question. The student's next step is to evaluate the correctness of the returned SQL query." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="jKMdS4HxjadTo048nWC6vouWftd" width="690" height="325" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1002574]** This image shows a student's successful attempt at using the TDS solver. The student wrote Python code to interact with a FastAPI server, using the `requests` library to send a POST request. The request includes both a question string and a CSV file as form data. The question asks for SQL to calculate the total sales of "Gold" tickets. The code executes successfully, returning a status code of 200, and the JSON response includes the SQL query: `SELECT SUM(units * price) AS total_sales FROM tickets WHERE LOWER (TRIM(type)) = 'gold';`. The image suggests a peer discussion where the student is posting their successful solution to help others., **[Discussion Image by 23f1002574]** This image depicts a student successfully interacting with the TDS solver API. The student's code, written in `burima.py`, imports the `requests` library and defines a URL pointing to a FastAPI server (likely the TDS solver endpoint). The code then crafts a `data` dictionary containing a question asking for the total sales of "Gold" tickets, formulating an appropriate SQL query. It then sends a POST request to the defined URL using the `requests.post` method, including the `data` dictionary containing the question. The terminal output shows that the script was executed successfully (`python burima.py`) with a status code of 200, and the Response JSON contains the generated SQL query that answers the posed question about "gold" ticket sales. This demonstrates a successful interaction where the student's natural language question is translated into a SQL query by the TDS solver. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1002574]** This image shows a student's Python code and the output from running the script to interact with a FastAPI server for the TDS project. The script, named "burima.py", imports the 'requests' library to send a POST request to a specified URL, which is intended to be the FastAPI server address ("http://16.16.189.187:8000/tdsp2"). The POST request sends a question about total sales for "Gold" ticket types along with a CSV file located at "C:/Users/suneh/Downloads/q-fastapi.csv". The terminal output shows a successful status code of 200, along with the server's JSON response containing an SQL query: "SELECT SUM(units * price) AS total_sales FROM tickets WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold';". The student is interacting correctly with the TDS server using the requests library and is receiving a generated SQL query in response to the question. 2x" data-dominant-color="222221">image1331Ã—627 52.2 KB
