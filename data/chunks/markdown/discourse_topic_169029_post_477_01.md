 “/api” which resulted in a 307 response or with “http” instead of “https” which resulted in a 302 response. Only the get requests were made to the correct endpoint but since the app was supposed to allow POST requests only, making GET requests just resulted in 405.

**[Discussion Image by 22f3000819]** The image depicts a student's screenshot of Google Cloud Run logs, specifically for the TDS Solver project ("tdsproject-shiva"). The logs show a series of messages related to "python-requests" and "GET" or "POST" operations, along with corresponding URLs related to the student's Cloud Run app, such as "https://tdsproject-shiva-8cilz3059f-uc.a.run.app/". Several log entries indicate "307 Temporary Redirect", suggesting the server is temporarily redirecting requests. Further entries detail "GET /agency_affil.css" and "GET /anchor_btn.css" requests, followed by "Client connection closed" messages, possibly indicating issues with client-side connections. The student appears to be troubleshooting network related issues with their deployed application using these logs.ential problems with how the application handles redirects or connection management. Further investigation into the proxy configuration and handling of temporary redirects would be necessary to troubleshoot the root cause." alt="1000150868" data-base62-sha1="lky6Y8v3m4mwEMctdZ1pVT72TA8" width="230" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f3000819]** The image shows a student's Google Cloud Run logs for their TDS project, specifically service details for "tdsproject2shiva". The logs display a sequence of events including "processing question", "started server process [1]", "Application startup complete", and various HTTP GET and POST requests with status codes such as "307 Temporary Redirect" and "405 Method Not Allowed". The logs also show specific URLs being accessed, indicating API calls for the solver project. The student is likely troubleshooting issues related to request methods and redirects within their deployed application, potentially related to incorrect API usage or configuration errors. The repetitive nature of the logs suggests a loop or recurring problem within the application's logic., **[Discussion Image by 22f3000819]** This image depicts a student's view of the Google Cloud Run logs for their TDS project. The logs show a series of events, including "processing question," "trying to load," "scaled model moldings," application startup, and several HTTP requests. The student is seeing a mix of HTTP 200 OK, 307 Temporary Redirect, and 405 Method Not Allowed responses, specifically for "GET /api/ HTTP/1.1". The logs are accessed through the Google Cloud Console, navigating to Cloud Run, selecting the service "tdsproject2shiva", and viewing the "Logs" tab with severity set to default. The "405 Method Not Allowed" errors are indicative of a problem with the HTTP method (GET) being used for a resource that either doesn't exist or requires a different method (like POST). 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f3000819]** This image shows a student's Google Cloud Run logs for their TDS project, specifically `tdsproject2shiva`. The logs indicate potential issues with API requests, displaying "307 Temporary Redirect" and "405 Method Not Allowed" errors alongside successful "200 OK" POST requests to `/api`. The logs also reveal initialization steps like "trying to load," "loaded embeddings," "started server process," and "application startup complete," as well as CORS being added. The student is likely debugging API endpoint behavior, focusing on understanding why certain requests are being redirected or disallowed, suggesting a need to review the API route definitions and allowed HTTP methods. The URL for the Cloud Run service is `https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app`. 2x" data-dominant-color="E4E5E6">10001508681080×2340 242 KB
