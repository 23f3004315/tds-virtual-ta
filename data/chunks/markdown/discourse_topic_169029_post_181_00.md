Q13 - Use GitHub: Since the parameter is just my email, this question *WILL NOT* be tested against any other email, right? So I can just have a repo with my email in it, right?

Check with other student if they have a different email then it is a parameter and can change.

Q2 - Compress an image: Should my appâ€™s response be like this

`{
 "answer": "base64_encoding_of_compressed_image"
`

This is correct, make sure you test decoding base64 string before deadline.

Q3 - Host your portfolio on GitHub Pages, Q7 - Create a GitHub action, Q8 - Push an Image to Docker Hub: Similar to GA1 Q13, these too have my email or roll number as parameter. These too **WILL NOT** be checked against any other email, right?

Same answer as Q13 GA1
