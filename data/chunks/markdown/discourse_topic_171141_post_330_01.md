**[Discussion Image by 23f2003751]** The image shows the file explorer in VS Code, displaying the "TDS_PROJECT_1" directory. Within this project, the "tds-project-1" subdirectory (indicated by a greyed-out expander arrow) and a "LICENSE" file are visible. The VS Code toolbar above shows options for creating new files, creating new folders, refreshing, and other standard functions. This likely illustrates a student's project setup, possibly related to a discrepancy or question about the file structure. The student is likely using VS Code to manage the project files.ory contains a subdirectory "tds-project-1" (collapsed, as indicated by the ">" icon) and a "LICENSE" file. The toolbar at the top shows icons for creating a new file, creating a new folder, refreshing the explorer view, and collapsing folders. The green circle next to "tds-project-1" in the explorer suggests that the directory is part of a git repository, indicating version control tracking. This simple file structure is likely being contrasted with an expected or ideal project setup within the discussion." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="bCYFeHxVzBnl2fAh3CxgzgJ8Xdw" width="205" height="88">image274Ã—118 2.87 KB
