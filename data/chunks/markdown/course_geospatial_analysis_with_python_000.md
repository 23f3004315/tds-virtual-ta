## Geospatial Analysis with Python

[**[Course Image: Geospatial analysis with Python]** This image showcases a Python-based geospatial analysis project, visualized within a Google Colab notebook. The primary focus is on displaying geospatial data, specifically a route or a series of points, overlaid on a Google Maps interface. The map depicts the New York City metropolitan area, highlighting the practical application of geospatial analysis techniques. The green points likely represent locations or waypoints along a specific route. The goal is to learn how to programmatically generate map visualizations and analyze geographical data within a Python environment.analysis performed within a Python environment (likely using libraries like GeoPandas or similar tools in Google Colab). The screenshot displays a map of the New York metropolitan area, overlaid with geospatial data represented by a series of blue and green markers (possibly points representing locations or events). These points seem to cluster along Manhattan Island, potentially indicating spatial patterns or concentrations of a specific phenomenon being analyzed. The analysis aims to visualize and understand spatial distributions and relationships using Python's geospatial libraries, which is a core aspect of geospatial analysis. This can enable tasks such as identifying hotspots, understanding spatial relationships, and informing decision-making based on location data.)](https://youtu.be/m_qayAJt-yE)

You'll learn how to perform geospatial analysis for location-based decision making, covering:

- **Distance Calculation**: Compute distances between various store locations and a reference point, such as the Empire State Building.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize store locations on a map using Python libraries like Folium.
- **Store Density Analysis**: Determine the number of stores within a specified radius.
- **Proximity Analysis**: Identify the closest and farthest stores from a specific location.
- **Decision Making**: Use geospatial data to assess whether opening a new store is feasible based on existing store distribution.
