 a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog.

I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for **Q8**.

Thankyou
