**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image captures a student's command-line interaction while working on Project 1 of the TDS course, specifically addressing discrepancies. The student successfully pulls the Docker image "rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3" using the command "docker pull --platform arm64 rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3". Following this, the student uses "docker images | grep "rohit23f1001156/project1_tds"" to confirm the image is present, displaying its name, tag (v3), image ID (468630ef32b8), age (5 weeks ago), and size (581MB). This suggests the student is attempting to use a specific Docker image version and verifying its successful download and availability on their system.6/project1_tds:v3` to download the specified image. The successful pull is confirmed by the "Downloaded newer image" message. Subsequently, the student uses `docker images | grep "rohit23f1001156/project1_tds"` to list Docker images and filter for the pulled image, confirming its presence and displaying metadata like tag (v3), image ID (468630ef32b8), age (5 weeks ago), and size (581MB). This is a practical demonstration of verifying the successful download and availability of a Docker image." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="uI24JOoUGpaMo1DE4B3RCtyoavI" width="690" height="98" data-dominant-color="1D211C">image1757Ã—250 24.9 KB
