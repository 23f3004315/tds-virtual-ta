**[Discussion Image by 21f2000370]** This image shows a question from "GA1 - Development Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]", specifically task 16, worth 0.5 marks, titled "Move and rename files." The task requires the student to download and extract `q-move-rename-files.zip`, then use the `mv` command to move all files within subfolders into a single empty folder. Next, they should rename each file by replacing each digit in the filename with the next digit (e.g., `a19b.txt` becomes `a20b.txt`). The question concludes by asking what the output of the bash command `grep .* | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` would be when run on that folder. This is a graded task presented by an instructor, which requires students to execute commands and interpret their output. extracting it, and then using the `mv` command to move all files from subfolders into an empty folder. The student must then rename the files by replacing each digit in the filename with the next digit (e.g., a19b.txt becomes a20b.txt). Finally, the student needs to determine the output of the bash command: `grep .* | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` when executed in the target folder. The student likely has to interpret the output of the grep command, then sort the results, and finally compute the SHA256 checksum of the sorted output." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="ztYoarmvww2WIkqZVCfsxgyDyhj" width="690" height="84" data-dominant-color="292D32">image1296Ã—158 7.29 KB
