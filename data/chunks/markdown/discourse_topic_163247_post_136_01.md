You would need to use professor Anand’s proxy or some other api key through which request can be made.

Url’s for free api keys:

AI Proxy
OpenAI GPT-4o · GitHub Models

The way to use api’s is demonstrated in live sessions, also refer to this documentation sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs.

For question 8, you’ll need to use OpenAI’s function calling feature and identify which function needs to be called and arguments to be used, we discussed in last Friday’s session on functions like `order` and `cancel_order`.

Kind regards
