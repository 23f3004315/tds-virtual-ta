**[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image shows a student's attempt to run a POST request in a tool like Postman or Insomnia for a TDS project, specifically project 1. The request is sent to `http://localhost:8000/run?task=Install uv (if required) and r`, with a parameter "task" set to "Install uv (if required) and ...". The response body is JSON format and indicates an error: "Failed to run datagen.py". The error message includes the command that failed, involving Python and a URL to `datagen.py` hosted on GitHub (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanando/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py`), indicating the script execution failed, returning a non-zero exit status of 2. The student is likely encountering issues with the `datagen.py` script during the project setup or execution phase. This is likely a question about a student facing a failed execution of the datagen.py script.`. This error indicates that the `datagen.py` script, located on GitHub, failed to execute properly, likely due to a problem with the script itself or its dependencies. The root cause could be issues like the Python script containing errors, missing dependencies, or problems with file permissions, where the exit status 2 suggests the program terminated due to an error. This shows a problem related to running the data generation script for project 1." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-15 001314" data-base62-sha1="82Lu1bafOSoTOnWb3DcmC7NgXWD" width="534" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image depicts a student encountering an error while using Postman to send a POST request to their localhost server for a TDS project.
