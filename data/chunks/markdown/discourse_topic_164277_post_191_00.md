Hi @Rishabh2

What exactly you mean by variables? only one argument is required for running `evaluate.py` that’s an email address.

You need to download both `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` in same folder and then execute `evaluate.py` using uv.

`uv run evaluate.py --email $any_email`.

For phase B

 Output specifications will be detailed in the “task” sent to the endpoint. 
Phase B is meant to be vague because if you can solve it, without an elaborate and gratuitous use of gpt function calling, then you can actually solve all tasks using the same function ! 
Kind regards

Kind regards
