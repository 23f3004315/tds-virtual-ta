**[Discussion Image by daksh76]** This image depicts a student's code and output, showcasing a task involving image processing using Python libraries. The student uploaded an image file named "lenna.webp" using `files.upload()` from `google.colab`. The code then reads the image using the PIL library, converts it to a NumPy array, and normalizes the RGB values. The code calculates the lightness for each pixel using the `colorsys.rgb_to_hls` function and counts the number of pixels with a lightness value greater than 0.219, printing the final count (248985) to the console. This provides a practical example of image manipulation and analysis, where the student is applying a formula and conditional check to the image data.es, and colorsys. The student uploads an image named "lenna.webp" using `files.upload()`, opens it with `Image.open()`, converts it to an RGB array, and then calculates the lightness of each pixel using `colorsys.rgb_to_hls()`. Finally, it counts the number of pixels with lightness greater than 0.219 and prints the result, which is "Number of pixels with lightness > 0.219: 248985." This is a demonstration of image processing and analysis within a Colab environment and represents a successful outcome of the student's code execution." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="89SW039dll0Yl6Te4yJEtu9ADmm" width="690" height="403" data-dominant-color="2F2E2E">image837Ã—490 26 KB
