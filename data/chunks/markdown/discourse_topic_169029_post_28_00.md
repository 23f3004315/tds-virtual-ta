Dear Sir,

I have few questions. It is written in the Tools in Data Science that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I donâ€™t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below.

In GA 1 ques 13 and GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI `gh` which we have to install in the vercel instance using `apt` package manager.

But, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages.
In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that?
