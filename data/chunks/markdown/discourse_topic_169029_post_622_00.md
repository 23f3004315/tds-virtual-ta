Greetings, @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to kindly request the addition of an API to the link I previously submitted for Project 2. I realized that including this API is essential for the complete functionality and demonstration of the project.

please use this api url -: https://rahulbot-a369.onrender.com/api/

instead of this - https://rahulbot-a369.onrender.com/

Thank you for your time and support. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Rahul Pathak
