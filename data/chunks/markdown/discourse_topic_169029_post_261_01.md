The error message "500: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR" with the code "FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED" signifies that the function failed to execute properly on the server. The error provides an ID, potentially useful for debugging within the Vercel platform. Troubleshooting suggestions are provided, encouraging the owner to learn how to fix the error and check the logs. This is likely a point of confusion for the student, requiring guidance to diagnose the cause of the function invocation failure, possibly related to code errors, missing dependencies, or configuration issues.rcel service. The specific error is "500: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR" with the code "FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED" and a unique ID, indicating a problem during the execution of the serverless function itself. The message suggests troubleshooting by checking the logs for more details to identify the cause of the failure, and includes a link to guidance on how to fix the error. This is likely a student facing this issue while trying to deploy or run their TDS Solver project.
