It indicates that the initial script failed to locate the Dockerfile in the root directory of the GitHub repository, a requirement that is now relaxed. The P1 submissions will be evaluated separately at the end of the term using a script that performs a directory tree search for the Dockerfile. The email also states that no changes to the GitHub repo after February 18th will be considered and no spelling deviations will be accepted in required files. The email reiterates that all other prerequisites must be met, and the Docker image must build without errors from the Dockerfile, with the built Docker container becoming operational within 5 minutes, and also emphasizing evaluation will occur in the specified test environment.ocker image must build without errors from the Dockerfile and the Docker container must become operational within 5 minutes of starting." alt="IMG_20250417_114002" data-base62-sha1="94gdAia3CpfNm8OXPu04KY1yckR" width="259" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1001822]** This image shows an email from the instructor Carlton D'Silva clarifying changes to the P1 (Project 1) requirements.

The email also emphasizes that no changes to the GitHub repo after February 18th will be considered and that no spelling deviations will be accepted in the required files, while all other prerequisites must still be met, including a successful Docker image build and a container that becomes operational within 5 minutes. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1001822]** This image shows an email from the instructor Carlton D'Silva regarding Project 1 (P1) requirements. The email indicates that P1s initially failed a pre-requisite due to the script's inability to find the Dockerfile in the root directory of the GitHub repo, and that this requirement is now relaxed. Furthermore, it highlights that P1 submissions will be checked separately at the end of the term, the script will perform a directory tree search for the Dockerfile, and no changes after Feb 18th or spelling errors in required files will be accepted.
