## Optional: Parse & clean PDF files with Tabula

[**[Course Image: Parse & clean PDF files with Tabula]** The image illustrates the process of extracting data from PDF files and converting it into a structured format like an Excel spreadsheet, specifically in the context of data journalism and archiving. Tabula is a tool commonly used to parse and clean PDF files, making it easier to work with data contained within them for analysis and archival purposes. This process is crucial for journalists and researchers who need to extract data from public records, reports, or other documents stored as PDFs. Mastering PDF data extraction and conversion with tools like Tabula is a key skill for effective data archiving and utilization in data-driven investigations. The image emphasizes the transformation of unstructured PDF data into a more usable, structured format for subsequent analysis and archiving.bula to parse and clean PDF files for data journalism, demonstrating a step in the archive process where unstructured data is transformed into a structured format. Tabula helps convert PDF documents into usable data tables, typically in a spreadsheet format like Excel. This process is crucial for extracting data from archived documents that may not be readily accessible in a machine-readable form. By using Tabula, students can efficiently extract tabular data, clean it, and prepare it for analysis or inclusion in their data journalism projects. The outcome is improved access to data within archives by converting the archive to the right format.)](https://youtu.be/IEusn9HB1sc)
