## Outlier Detection with Excel

[**[Course Image: Outlier detection with Excel]** To detect outliers in Excel, one method involves using quartiles. Specifically, the image shows the Excel formula `=QUARTILE.EXC(A2:A844,3)` being entered into cell D3. This formula calculates the third quartile (75th percentile) of the data range A2 to A844. The `QUARTILE.EXC` function excludes the median when calculating the quartiles, providing a more precise outlier detection method compared to `QUARTILE.INC`. Using this quartile value can help establish thresholds beyond which data points are considered outliers, which is a useful data analysis technique.an utilize the `QUARTILE.EXC` function. This function helps calculate quartiles, which are essential for identifying data points significantly above or below the typical range. The syntax is `QUARTILE.EXC(array, quart)`, where "array" is the range of cells containing your data (e.g., A2:A844), and "quart" specifies which quartile to calculate (1 for the first quartile, 3 for the third quartile). By calculating the first and third quartiles, you can determine the interquartile range (IQR) and subsequently identify outliers based on a multiple of the IQR. For example, the formula `=QUARTILE.EXC(A2:A844,3)` calculates the third quartile of the data in cells A2 through A844, which is a key step in defining the upper boundary for outlier detection.)](https://youtu.be/sUTJb0F9eBw)

You'll learn how to identify and handle outliers in data using Excel, covering:

- **Understanding Outliers**: Definition of outliers and their impact on statistical analysis.
- **Calculating Quartiles**: Using Excel formulas to calculate Q1 (first quartile) and Q3 (third quartile).
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Finding the IQR by subtracting Q1 from Q3.
- **Determining Bounds**: Calculating lower and upper bounds using 1.5 times the IQR.
- **Identifying Outliers**: Using Excel functions to determine if data points fall outside the calculated bounds.
- **Visualizing Data**: Creating box plots to visualize outliers and data distribution.
- **Handling Outliers**: Deciding whether to exclude or keep outliers based on their impact on analysis.
