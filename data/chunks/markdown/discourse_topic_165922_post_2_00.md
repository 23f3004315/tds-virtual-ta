Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:

**Isolation** – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.

**Reproducibility** – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.

**Portability** – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.

**Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name)**

• Good for quick experimentation and testing.

• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.

**Using requirements.txt**

• Best for **reproducibility** and **collaboration** since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.

**Specifying Versions in requirements.txt**

• If you **don’t specify a version**, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.
