**[Discussion Image by 22f3000585]** This image captures an error message received by student 22f3000585 on their TDS Project 1 submission, indicating a failure. The error message states "No such repo; No "MIT" in LICENSE; No Dockerfile." This implies that either the GitHub repository link provided for the project is incorrect or inaccessible, the LICENSE file does not contain the term "MIT," and no Dockerfile was detected in the repository. This is likely from an automated script during assignment grading, providing feedback to the student to correct these issues and resubmit. The student needs to verify the repository URL, ensure the LICENSE file is present and includes "MIT", and add a Dockerfile to the repository."image" data-base62-sha1="5dAkdiPnbVOkt7Z0WQwq7j58kXo" width="690" height="83" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f3000585]** This image captures an automated message indicating that a student's (22f3000585) submission for the TDS project-1, located at the specified GitHub repository, has failed. The message lists three primary reasons for the failure: "No such repo," indicating a problem with the repository link or accessibility; "No 'MIT' in LICENSE," suggesting that the required MIT license is either missing from the repository or not correctly identified in the LICENSE file; and "No Dockerfile," indicating the absence of a Dockerfile in the repository. These errors provide direct feedback to the student regarding the issues that need to be resolved before resubmitting the project, particularly focusing on repository accessibility, license compliance, and the inclusion of a Dockerfile. This is part of a student discussion where the student is attempting to understand why their submission failed automatically and seeking resolution., **[Discussion Image by 22f3000585]** This image depicts a system-generated error message in response to a student's project submission, indicating a failure with specific reasons. The error message states that the submission at the provided GitHub URL (https://github.com/22f3000585/tds_project-1.git) resulted in a "FAIL" status. The reasons listed for the failure are: "No such repo," "No 'MIT' in LICENSE," and "No Dockerfile." This indicates that the system couldn't find the specified repository, didn't find the string "MIT" within a LICENSE file, and couldn't find a Dockerfile in the submitted repository, all required elements of the project. This suggests a problem with either the repository's existence, the presence of a valid LICENSE file containing "MIT," or the existence of a Dockerfile at the root of the submitted project. The message prompts the student to check the repository URL, confirm the presence and content of the LICENSE file, and ensure a Dockerfile exists in the root directory of their project. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f3000585]** This image captures part of an automated feedback message in a TDS project discussion. It indicates a student's GitHub repository submission (https://github.com/22f3000585/tds_project-1.git) has failed validation. The error messages point to three specific issues: "No such repo," "No 'MIT' in LICENSE," and "No Dockerfile." These errors suggest either the repository link is incorrect, the LICENSE file doesn't contain the expected "MIT" license text, or a Dockerfile is missing from the repository. Thus, the student needs to verify the repository address, the contents of the LICENSE file, and the presence of a Dockerfile. 2x" data-dominant-color="EFF0F1">image836Ã—101 18.2 KB
