**[Discussion Image by 22f3002771]** This image shows a student's Python code within the TDS project discussion thread. The code defines two asynchronous functions, `a2` and `a3`, likely for formatting Markdown files using `prettier@3.4.2`. Function `a2` reads an email, formats it, then compares it against a formatted result, potentially using `subprocess.run` to execute the `prettier` command. Function `a3` is only stubbed out. The student is working on automating Markdown formatting as part of an LLM-based agent project, likely encountering issues integrating the `prettier` tool into their workflow. The file path "/data/format.md" suggests a specific directory structure relevant to the project setup., likely asking for help or showcasing their approach." alt="Screenshot from 2025-02-12 20-21-56" data-base62-sha1="3yiVgj5MK4I0OIhWEkiH5rjnAJF" width="690" height="259" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f3002771]** This image depicts a student's Python code within the TDS Project 1 discussion. The code snippet presents two asynchronous functions, `a2` and `a3`, likely part of an automation agent related to email and data formatting. Function `a2` formats a file using `prettier@3.4.2` via a subprocess call with `npx`, reading the file content and comparing it to the expected output, and includes error handling via `mismatch` function (not shown). Function `a3` seems related to date extraction from email. The bottom panel shows "PROBLEMS OUTPUT DEBUG CONSOLE TERMINAL PORTS" suggesting active debugging in the development environment., **[Discussion Image by 22f3002771]** This image shows a snippet of Python code from a student's project, likely during a peer discussion or when seeking help with their implementation, focusing on the `a2` function which uses `subprocess.run` to format a markdown file using `prettier@3.4.2`. The function reads the content of the markdown file associated with an email, then uses `prettier` to format it, comparing the expected formatted output against the actual content. Key parameters for `subprocess.run` are visible including `input`, `capture_output`, `text`, and `shell` set to `True`, and the file path is being passed via the `--stdin-filepath` flag. The code aims to update the file in-place using `prettier`, while also ensuring `npx` is accessible in the system's PATH. The student is likely implementing or debugging an automated formatting process for markdown files related to emails as part of the project. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f3002771]** This image depicts a code snippet, likely a Python function named `a2` within a larger project, shared by a student in the TDS "Project 1" discussion. The `a2` function appears to format markdown files using `prettier@3.4.2` via the `subprocess.run` function, taking an email (string), file path (string), and optional keyword arguments. It reads the original content, executes prettier, compares the formatted output with the expected result, and returns whether the formatting was successful. Comments indicate consideration for ensuring `npx` is accessible, particularly on Windows systems, suggesting the student is troubleshooting cross-platform compatibility. The code uses async/await patterns, indicating a focus on asynchronous operations within the project. 2x" data-dominant-color="212121">Screenshot from 2025-02-12 20-21-561501Ã—564 61.8 KB
