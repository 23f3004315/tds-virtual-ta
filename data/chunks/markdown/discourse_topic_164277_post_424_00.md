## Post #424 by abhigyandsa

**Direct Link**: [Post #424](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/164277/424)

for the datagen script is it ok to hardcode the scripts url and my email id? I understand the script itself may change but can I count on the link remaining the same? Also is it necessary to pass the email as argument?
