Gentlemen! In GA2 answers, I have a problem.

Question 10, the ngrok tunnel url was once correct and I saved it . When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect.

Do I need to do anything else ?

Secondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved.

Third, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 â€¦it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks &amp; regards.
