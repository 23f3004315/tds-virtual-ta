Sir,

In the mail that i got about project 1 report. In the log file it was written as TasksA.py file not found in docker, which was the case i observed with many students.

The traceback indicates the error originates in `/app/app.py` at line 22 due to the statement `from tasksA import *`. The error message `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tasksA'` reveals that the Python interpreter cannot find a module named "tasksA". The successful installation of 33 packages suggests that general dependency installation isn't the issue, but rather that "tasksA" is either misspelled, not installed, or located in a directory not accessible in the PYTHONPATH. The student is likely facing issues running their `app.py` file for a TDS project due to a missing or incorrectly configured module named `tasksA`.data science libraries, but the 'tasksA' module itself is either missing, incorrectly named, or not within the Python path. The student is likely seeking guidance on resolving this import error and understanding why the 'tasksA' module cannot be found." alt="Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 10.31.02 AM" data-base62-sha1="ltGd9jH4WOl0KbWRMzDWE1C4JCw" width="690" height="460" srcset="**[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image depicts a student's error and is likely a question posted in the discussion board. The code output shows successful installation of multiple python packages (scipy, pandas, numpy, pydantic-core, duckdb). However, the program terminates with a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tasksA'`, indicating that the python interpreter cannot find a module or package named `tasksA` that the code tries to import from line 22 of the file `/app/app.py` with the statement `from tasksA import *`. This implies either a typo in the module name, the module is not installed, or the module is not in the python path. The student is likely seeking help on how to resolve this import error by identifying the correct module name or installing the missing dependency., **[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image shows a student encountering a `ModuleNotFoundError` after installing packages, indicating a coding or environment setup issue. The error, "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tasksA'," arises during the execution of `/app/app.py` at line 22 where the code attempts to import all members from a module named `tasksA`. The traceback indicates that the Python interpreter cannot find the 'tasksA' module, suggesting it might not be installed, misspelled in the import statement, or not present in the current Python environment or path. The output also shows that several packages including scipy, pandas, numpy, pydantic-core, and duckdb were successfully downloaded and installed before the error occurred, implying that basic package installation is functional but the specific 'tasksA' module is the source of the problem. This is likely a student question/problem. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image shows a student question relating to a "ModuleNotFoundError" in a TDS project discussion.

The error, `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tasksA'`, signifies that the `tasksA` module is either not installed, not located in the correct directory, or misspelled in the import statement. 2x" data-dominant-color="E7E7E7">Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 10.31.02 AM1358Ã—906 47.7 KB
