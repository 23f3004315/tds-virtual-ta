## Post #429 by 22f3002291

**Direct Link**: [Post #429](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/169029/429)

My IITM student dashboard on the portal shows absent for course project (COURSE PROJET - Absent). Is this referring to project 1 or 2? Coz i missed Project 1 but submitted Project 2 successfully. Also the logs show that the evaluation was performed on the submitted enpoint. So should I be concerned about the dashboard showing ‘Absent’ or will it be updated in a few days?
