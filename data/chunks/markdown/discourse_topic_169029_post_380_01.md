 using the azure VM itself.

I rechecked and maybe the server went offline, so I re-ran the script anyway and checked a few questions now and it works.

**[Discussion Image by ItsMeAlex]** This image depicts a student's attempt to interact with an API using a tool like Postman, as part of the "Project 2 - TDS Solver" assignment. The student sends a POST request to the endpoint "104.211.116.95:8080/api" with a "question" parameter set to "Install and run Visual Studio Code. In your Terminal (or...)", using the "form-data" content type. The response body, formatted as JSON, is visible and labeled "answer", containing extensive system information like OS version, CPU details, memory, GPU status, and various rendering engine configurations, suggesting that the server processed the question and returned system diagnostics. The response status is "200 OK", indicating a successful request, although the relevance of the information to the initial question is unclear without further context, showing a possible area of confusion.g successful retrieval of information related to the student's question.
