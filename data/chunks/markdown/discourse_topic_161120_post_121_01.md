**[Discussion Image by 24ds1000082_Vivek]** This image shows a student's browser window during a debugging session related to a web application, likely as part of the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion. The left side displays JSON data retrieved from the API endpoint `/api?class=SN&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`, which lists student IDs and their corresponding classes. The right side shows the Chrome Developer Tools, specifically the "Network" tab, indicating a successful (Status 200) HTTP request to that API. In the "Issues" tab within the DevTools, there's a warning about a form field element lacking an "id" or "name" attribute, suggesting a potential accessibility or form submission issue in the application's HTML. The student appears to be examining the API response in the context of debugging a deployment-related issue, possibly related to data fetching or rendering.hough this appears unrelated to the API call's success. This capture indicates Vivek may be debugging the API response data or investigating the source of the form-related warning." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="gNENaR9HUD8nYGftFdiR64nAd5I" width="690" height="238" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 24ds1000082_Vivek]** This image shows a student examining the network response in the Chrome DevTools as part of the TDS "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion. The student is likely debugging an API call, as the "Network" tab is open, displaying the request to `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=SN&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`. The response data in the "Pretty-print" format shows a JSON array of student ID and class objects, indicating a successful (status 200) API retrieval of student data filtered by class. The "Issues" tab at the bottom indicates a warning, “A form field element should have an id or name attribute”, suggesting a potential problem in the HTML structure, unrelated to the immediate API data being examined., **[Discussion Image by 24ds1000082_Vivek]** This image is from a student discussion about deployment tools in the TDS Jan 2025 cohort, depicting a troubleshooting scenario related to an API call. The left side of the screen shows the JSON response from an API endpoint at `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`, which returns an array of student objects, each containing "studentId" and "class" fields. The right side displays the Chrome DevTools Network tab, showing the API request's status as 200 (OK), type as "document," size as 694B, and a load time of 28ms. The DevTools "Issues" tab is also open, showing a warning about a form field element lacking an "id" or "name" attribute, though this may not be directly related to the API call itself but rather a frontend issue. This indicates the student is likely debugging the API response or the interaction between the frontend and backend. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 24ds1000082_Vivek]** This image shows the browser's developer tools for troubleshooting a student's API call. On the left side, the 'Pretty-print' view shows a JSON response containing a list of objects, each with 'studentId' and 'class' fields, returned from the API endpoint "127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W". On the right side, the 'Network' tab shows a successful (status 200) GET request to the API endpoint, which took 12ms and transferred 694B of data. The 'Console' tab shows a warning: "A form field element should have an id or name attribute", which is likely unrelated to the primary problem but flags a potential issue with form structure. This indicates the student is examining the API response and request details to verify the data and performance. 2x" data-dominant-color="F3F4F6">image1903×657 83.4 KB
