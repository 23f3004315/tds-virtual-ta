**[Discussion Image by satviksawhney]** This image shows a file directory structure, likely within a code repository or project, and highlights a student's issue with a Dockerfile. It's part of a peer discussion or could be an instructor pointing out an error. The directory contains folders such as "Business", "Operations", and "app", along with files named "Dockerfile", "LICENSE", and "README.md." Notably, the Dockerfile's description indicates that it was recently renamed from "dockerfile" to "Dockerfile," suggesting that the student had initially named it incorrectly. This correction likely resolves a problem where Docker couldn't find the file due to the incorrect capitalization, hence the student's reported issue being fixed. The files are timestamped "2 days ago", "yesterday", and "3 days ago", showing recent activity in the repository.EDGJRO6bakiN" width="690" height="170" srcset="**[Discussion Image by satviksawhney]** This image represents a student's file directory structure within a coding project, potentially related to a Docker assignment and shows a student question. The directory includes folders like "Business," "Operations," and "app," along with files named "Dockerfile," "LICENSE," and "README.md". The "app" folder has been updated to include "Dockerfile" and "requirements.txt", while the commit message "Rename dockerfile to Dockerfile" indicates a potential naming correction. A key problem highlighted is the proper capitalization of "Dockerfile," which appears as "dockerfile" in the directory, suggesting this capitalization discrepancy is the student's issue. Correcting the filename case could resolve the Docker build problem., **[Discussion Image by satviksawhney]** This image from a TDS student discussion depicts the file structure of a project. It shows folders named "Business," "Operations," and "app," along with files like "Dockerfile," "LICENSE," and "README.md" in the root directory. Specifically, the "Dockerfile" was renamed from "dockerfile" to "Dockerfile" recently. The student's issue likely stems from the case sensitivity of the Dockerfile name, which is commonly required to be named "Dockerfile" without any lowercase characters for Docker to recognize it during the build process. This likely resolves the issue of Docker not recognizing the file, as suggested by the discussion context. The "app" folder contains an updated Dockerfile and requirements.txt file, possibly indicating where the original incorrect-named file was previously stored. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by satviksawhney]** This image shows a student's project directory structure in what appears to be a code repository, likely related to a Docker project. The "app" folder contains "Dockerfile" and "requirements.txt" files, and there is a separate file listed as "dockerfile" which has been renamed to "Dockerfile." The file list also includes "LICENSE" and "README.md" files at the root level, indicating a well-structured project. This aligns with the student's question about having submitted "dockerfile" while everything else works, indicating a potential issue with case sensitivity or file naming conventions for Dockerfiles. The UI is a file browser with file names, modification descriptions, and timestamps. 2x" data-dominant-color="15181D">Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 1.53.10 PM1889×467 54 KB
