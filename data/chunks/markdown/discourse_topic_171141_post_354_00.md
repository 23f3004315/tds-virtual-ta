You can take it up with @s.anand

I did not come up with the standard.

And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files.

Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.

Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of the adjustments we considered and asked Anand if we could make the allowance. He made the decision to enforce this protocol.

Kindest regards.
