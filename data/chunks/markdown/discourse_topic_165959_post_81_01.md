**[Discussion Image by 21f2000588]** This screenshot shows the GitHub Actions tab of a repository named "TDS_GA_4" owned by user "DigvijaysinhChudasamaliTM". The left sidebar provides navigation to different sections like "All workflows", "Daily Commit", "Caches", "Attestations", "Runners", "Usage metrics", and "Performance metrics". The main content displays a list of workflow runs for the "Daily Commit" workflow, including their run number, status (success with green checkmark, failure with red 'x'), trigger event (e.g., manually run, scheduled), the branch (main), and the time elapsed since the run. A banner at the top encourages users to provide feedback on GitHub Actions. The screenshot shows successful and failed runs, indicating the user is likely troubleshooting their GitHub Actions configuration, as can be inferred from the "TDS Jan 2025" GA4 Data Sourcing Discussion Thread context.g the execution history and status of their automated workflows, such as "Daily Commit," for potential issues or successful runs within their GA4 project." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="802XNXrWZ5eqWWHeszELpHQgezy" width="690" height="319" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 21f2000588]** This image shows a view of the GitHub Actions interface within the TDS_GA_4 repository of the user "DigvijaysinhChudasamaTM". It displays the "All workflows" page, listing recent runs of the "Daily Commit" workflow. The list shows the workflow run number, the trigger (manual or scheduled), the user who triggered the run, the status (success/failure indicated by green check or red cross), timestamp and the branch (main) of each run. The purpose is likely to review the execution history and status of the "Daily Commit" workflow, possibly for debugging or monitoring purposes within a student assignment. This is likely a student showcasing successful github actions, in the discussion thread., **[Discussion Image by 21f2000588]** This image shows a student's GitHub Actions interface, part of a peer discussion related to data sourcing in GA4. The student, DigvijaysinhChudasamalITM, has navigated to the "Actions" tab of their "TDS_GA_4" repository, where they can view workflow runs. Specifically, the "All workflows" section displays a list of "Daily Commit" workflow runs, including status (indicated by green checkmarks for success and red crosses for failure), commit messages, event times, and the branch "main." It shows 15 workflow runs in total. Several workflows have passed successfully, whereas several have failed. This is likely an illustration to facilitate discussion about workflow execution and troubleshooting within the student group. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 21f2000588]** This image depicts a student's view of the "Actions" tab within their GitHub repository "DigvijaysinhChudasamalITM / TDS_GA_4", showing workflow runs for "Daily Commit." The left sidebar shows navigation elements like "All workflows," "Daily Commit," and management options such as "Caches," "Attestations," "Runners," "Usage metrics," and "Performance metrics." The main content displays a list of "Daily Commit" workflow runs, including information on when they were triggered (e.g., "18 minutes ago," "4 hours ago"), their status (indicated by a checkmark or cross), and the triggering actor or event (e.g., "Manually run by DigvijaysinhChudasamalITM," "Scheduled"). Several workflows have completed successfully, but some failed, which might indicate a debugging or configuration issue the student is seeking help with. The image provides a visual overview of the student's workflow execution history and could be used to ask questions about specific failures or to demonstrate successful workflow configurations. 2x" data-dominant-color="11151B">image1920Ã—889 82 KB
