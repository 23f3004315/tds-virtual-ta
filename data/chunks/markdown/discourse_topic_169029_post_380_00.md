@Saransh_Saini - This is 24f1001631

The same thing has happened to me as the mentioned above. I also have not received request from Indian IP as far as I can see on the logs. I am using the azure VM itself.

I rechecked and maybe the server went offline, so I re-ran the script anyway and checked a few questions now and it works.

I think after a certain while it timed out for me(not entirely sure tho)â€¦ but i fixed it.
