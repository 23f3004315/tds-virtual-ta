The interface displays the logged-in student's email (23f2005327@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) and provides a logout button. Notably, it also features a section for "Recent saves," showing the dates and times of previous saves along with their corresponding scores (e.g., "Reload from 05/02/2025, 23:12:21. Score: 5.5"). This suggests the student can reload previous versions of their assignment work, and the image provides context of interface elements and information available to the student, but no student question or error message.
