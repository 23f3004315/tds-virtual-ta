**[Discussion Image by 23ds1000022]** This image shows a student's attempt to answer a question in the TDS GA3 assignment focusing on function calling with LLMs. The student is prompted to input the API URL endpoint, providing an example of `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`. The student enters this exact URL, but receives an error: "Failed to fetch: Bad Request". The exercise description emphasizes the need to enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin, suggesting the student likely has a CORS configuration issue preventing the API from being accessed by the test environment. The system indicates that it will send a GET request to the provided URL with a query parameter `q=...`, containing a task to verify the API's response. It also reminds the user that the arguments must be in the same order as the function definition provided earlier in JSON format.with query parameters and verifying the response. The displayed JSON shows the expected structure with "name" and "arguments" fields which are function-calling specifications for the LLM interaction." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-30 at 3.57.17 PM" data-base62-sha1="nyxFayPyJSDzPwCnrykGS2l69Li" width="690" height="431" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23ds1000022]** This image depicts a student's attempt to provide an API URL in a TDS assignment related to function calling and LLMs, specifically problem "Get an LLM to say Yes." The task requires the student to input the API URL endpoint for their implementation of "get_ticket_status," which should handle GET requests with CORS enabled. The student entered `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`, but the system returned an error message "Error: Failed to fetch: Bad Request." The platform indicates that it will test the URL by sending a GET request with a query parameter `q=...`, and verifies the response and argument order matches the function definition. Therefore, the student is encountering a problem with their API endpoint preventing a successful GET request., **[Discussion Image by 23ds1000022]** This image captures a student's attempt to configure an API endpoint within the TDS GA3 LLM assignment focused on function calling, specifically related to a 'get_ticket_status' function that takes 'ticket_id' as an argument, with the correct answer worth 6.5 of 9.5 points. The task instructions require enabling CORS for GET requests. The student enters the suggested endpoint 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute', but encounters a 'Failed to fetch: Bad Request' error, implying potential issues with the server at that address or the format of the request. The system validates the endpoint by sending a GET request with a query parameter '?q=...' and also checks that the order of arguments matches the function definition. This seems to be a question asked by student in order to solve a problem. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23ds1000022]** This image shows a student facing an error in the TDS GA3 exam while implementing function calling in January 2025. The student is prompted to provide the API URL endpoint, with an example URL provided as "http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute". After entering the same URL, the system returns an error "Error: Failed to fetch: Bad Request", indicating a problem with the API endpoint or the request itself, further prompting the student to ensure CORS is enabled. The task involves the "get_ticket_status" function, with "ticket_id": 83742 as its argument, suggesting the system checks via GET requests with "?q=...", verifying arguments are in the correct order and CORS is enabled to allow GET requests. The student's current score is 6.5/9.5, highlighting an active, partially completed assessment state. 2x" data-dominant-color="2A3131">Screenshot 2025-01-30 at 3.57.17 PM2048×1280 284 KB
