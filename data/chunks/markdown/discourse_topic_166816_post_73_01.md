**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image depicts a portion of a student's grade dashboard in the TDS (Training Data Science) course, specifically related to assignment "tds-2025-01-ga3." The dashboard displayes the user's email, `23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`, along with submission timestamps, and the scores received on specific dates. The table shows three entries for the same assignment, all associated with the same email address but with different submission dates (2025-02-06 01:13:34, 2025-02-06 00:22:25, and 2025-02-05 23:59:07). These entries show a first score of 4.5, a second of 4.5, and a third of 3.5, with all three having an identical second score of 9.5. This suggests potential issues with how grades are being recorded or displayed, which could be the source of the student's confusion about incorrect or missing scores.he student is likely questioning why the scores differ across what appears to be the same assignment." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-20 at 7.52.54 am" data-base62-sha1="3JrWSy6dvfzM3E0iJFagbbMJK9X" width="690" height="72" srcset="**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image shows a table-like view from a TDS (Training Data Science) student discussion regarding potentially incorrect or missing scores on a graded assignments dashboard. The view displays data related to three submissions of the assignment "tds-2025-01-ga3" by the student with the email "23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". Each row represents a submission, showing the submission timestamp (e.g., "2025-02-06 01:13:34") and two associated score values, where the first score varies between 3.5 and 4.5, while the second is consistently 9.5. This presentation likely forms part of the student's evidence in questioning the accuracy of the graded assignment dashboard, as they highlight inconsistencies in scores for the same assignment. The student is implicitly asking why there are different scores recorded for a single assignment, especially the first score which varies., **[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image depicts a snippet from a student's graded assignments dashboard within the TDS course, showcasing potential scoring discrepancies. The screenshot lists three entries for "tds-2025-01-ga3" associated with the same student email "23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." Each entry has a timestamp (e.g., "2025-02-06 01:13:34") and two numerical scores: the first score varies between 3.5 and 4.5, while the second score remains consistently at 9.5. This suggests that the student, Carlton, is showing inconsistent grading data, where the first score in particular may be incorrect or missing for certain assignments, causing confusion about the accuracy of their grades. The consistently high second score may represent the total points possible, with the varying first score representing points earned. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image is from a student discussion regarding potentially incorrect or missing scores on a graded assignments dashboard. The image displays a table-like view of assignment records, specifically showing three instances of "tds-2025-01-ga3" associated with the student email "23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." Each assignment record includes a timestamp indicating when the assignment was likely submitted or processed (e.g., "2025-02-06 01:13:34"), followed by two numerical values which are most likely the grades. In the image, it shows inconsistencies where the same assignment "tds-2025-01-ga3" has different grades of 4.5 or 3.5 with the same overall grade of 9.5, implying that a portion of the assignment is graded out of 10 and a portion is out of 5. This discrepancy likely prompts the student's question about the accuracy of the displayed scores. 2x" data-dominant-color="EEEEEE">Screenshot 2025-02-20 at 7.52.54 am2622Ã—274 23.1 KB
