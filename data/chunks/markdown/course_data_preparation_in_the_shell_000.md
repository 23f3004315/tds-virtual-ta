## Data Preparation in the Shell

[**[Course Image: Data preparation in the shell]** This image showcases a Google search result for "DataForSEO", a platform offering data-driven SEO tools and APIs. While the image itself doesn't directly teach shell commands, it illustrates a scenario where data preparation using shell tools might be necessary. For instance, if you were scraping data from DataForSEO's API, you could use shell commands to clean, transform, and analyze the retrieved data. In the context of data preparation in the shell, this highlights the importance of being able to process external data sources accessed through APIs or other means, thus requiring skills such as `curl`, `jq`, and standard text processing utilities.ch for "DATAFORSEO" as part of a lesson on data preparation in the shell, likely demonstrating how to find and access data sources. In the context of shell scripting, this suggests a step where you might use command-line tools like `curl` or `wget` to download data from websites like DataForSEO for subsequent processing. The search results highlight DataForSEO's API, which might be the target for extracting SEO data using shell commands. This process aligns with data preparation because the extracted data will likely need cleaning, transformation, and formatting using shell tools like `sed`, `awk`, and `grep` before analysis. Understanding how to programmatically access data sources is a crucial first step in any data preparation workflow.)](https://youtu.be/XEdy4WK70vU)

You'll learn how to use UNIX tools to process and clean data, covering:

- `curl` (or `wget`) to fetch data from websites.
- `gzip` (or `xz`) to compress and decompress files.
- `wc` to count lines, words, and characters in text.
- `head` and `tail` to get the start and end of files.
- `cut` to extract specific columns from text.
- `uniq` to de-duplicate lines.
- `sort` to sort lines.
- `grep` to filter lines containing specific text.
- `sed` to search and replace text.
- `awk` for more complex text processing.
