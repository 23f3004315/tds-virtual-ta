## Post #525 by Srishty_Snehi

**Direct Link**: [Post #525](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/169029/525)

Request a re-evaluation of my **Project 2** score. Despite submitting the project as per the given deadlines, my portal currently shows a score of **0**.

I have cross-checked my submissions and believe there may have been an error in evaluation or in updating the marks
