**[Discussion Image by adi3]** This image provides the task instructions for the TDS Project 2, focusing on analyzing a GZipped Apache log file of the website s-anand.net. It describes the log file's structure, noting it contains 258,074 rows with each row corresponding to a web log entry with the site. Each row is further described by its fields, for instance, IP, Remote Logname, Remote User, Time, Request, Status, Size, Referer, User Agent, Vhost, and Server, along with example data for each. Special attention is drawn to the data formatting; specifically, fields are separated by spaces and quoted by double quotes ("), with escaped quotes represented as \", unlike CSV files, and with all data in GMT-0500. The primary task is to filter the log entries for requests where the URL begins with "/malayalammp3/" and made on "2024-05-15", then to aggregate the data by summing the "Size" field for each unique IP address from the filtered entries.mage serves as problem statement and RAG training data, enabling future students to resolve similar issues in log file analysis." alt="WhatsApp Image 2025-03-27 at 13.41.43_5bd0a182" data-base62-sha1="b4lm39wJ9R3tDVR7qK0kX6mx7K0" width="690" height="461" srcset="**[Discussion Image by adi3]** This image shows the task instructions for "Project 2 - TDS Solver". The task involves analyzing a GZipped Apache log file with 258,074 rows, where each row represents a web log entry for the site "s-anand.net" in May 2024, and specifies the different fields present in each row like IP, Remote logname, Remote user, Time, Request (method, URL, protocol), Status, Size, Referer, User agent, Vhost, and Server, indicating that the fields are separated by spaces and quoted by double quotes, with quotes escaped as '\'. The instructions specify to filter the log entries, extracting those where the URL starts with "/malayalammp3/" and were made on 2024-05-15, then to aggregate data by IP by summing the "Size" field for each unique IP address from the filtered entries. This document is used as the basis of a discussion thread., **[Discussion Image by adi3]** This image shows a task description from a TDS course, providing details about an Apache log file analysis project. The log file (61MB) contains 258,074 rows of web log entries for the site s-anand.net from May 2024. The task specifies the fields within each row, including IP address, remote logname, remote user, time, request (method, URL, protocol), status, size, referer, user agent, vhost, and server IP. The fields are space-separated and quoted by double quotes, with special characters escaped using `\"`. Two specific tasks are outlined: (1) filter log entries for requests where the URL starts with `/malayalammp3/` and are made on 2024-05-15, and (2) aggregate data by summing the "Size" field for each unique IP address from the filtered entries. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by adi3]** This image shows the "Your Task" instructions for the "Project 2 - TDS Solver" assignment, providing specifications for analyzing an Apache log file. It details the structure of each log entry (258,074 rows in a 61MB GZipped file), listing the fields like IP, Remote logname, Remote user, Time, Request, Status, Size, Referer, User agent, Vhost, and Server. The key details include that the time is not quoted, the request has 3 space-separated parts (method, URL, protocol), fields are space-separated and double-quoted with \" escapes, and the data is in GMT-0500. The task specifically requires filtering log entries to extract requests with URLs starting with "/malayalammp3/" on "2024-05-15" and then aggregating the "Size" field for each unique IP address from the filtered results. This serves as a clear problem statement and data schema for the student project. 2x" data-dominant-color="2B2E33">WhatsApp Image 2025-03-27 at 13.41.43_5bd0a1821600Ã—1069 246 KB
