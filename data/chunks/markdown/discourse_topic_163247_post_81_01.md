**[Discussion Image by 22f2001630]** This image shows a student working on a graded assignment within the TDS Jan 2025 GA3 Large Language Models discussion. The task involves creating the JSON body for an OpenAI chat completion call to generate fake but plausible U.S. addresses using the gpt-4o-mini model. The assignment description specifies that the model should "respond in JSON", "generate 10 random addresses in the US" with a "structured output" of array of object addresses, with required fields apartment(string), zip(number) latitude(number), and set additional Properties to false. The student has a score of 1/9.5 and sees error messages related to "required" fields and "additionalProperties" within the object and, despite instructions not to run the request, is prompted to figure out how to enable the answer box as part of the test.ed" fields not being included and the need to explicitly set "additionalProperties": false for every object, hinting at JSON schema validation. A note clarifies that the student doesn't need to run the request or use an API key; the task involves writing the correct JSON body, suggesting it's a coding or JSON formatting exercise. The student seems stuck at the initial stage because there is no answer box to input the JSON, which is part of the test." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="3uazXYiC4brtL9ropoTKR0yZDUM" width="690" height="388" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f2001630]** This image shows a student's view of a Graded Assignment on the IITM online learning platform within the TDS (Topic Discussion System). The assignment, "GA3 - Large Language Models," requires creating a JSON body for an OpenAI chat completion call. The task involves designing a service that uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-Mini to generate fake but plausible address data following specific formatting rules. The student has a score of 1/9.5 and is receiving error messages indicating that the "required" field and "additionalProperties" constraints are not being met in their JSON structure. The assignment prompt notes the need to figure out how to enable an answer box., **[Discussion Image by 22f2001630]** This image captures a graded assignment problem within a TDS (Training Data Science) course focused on Large Language Models, specifically utilizing OpenAI's API. The assignment requires students to formulate the correct JSON body for an OpenAI chat completion call, given a context about RapidRoute Solutions generating realistic address data with GPT-40-Mini. The instructions specify using structured outputs containing an array of address objects with required fields like apartment (string), zip (number), and latitude (number), while also setting `additionalProperties` to `false`. An error message highlights that `"required"` fields must be explicitly included and that OpenAI necessitates `"additionalProperties": false` within the JSON object; the student's score is 1/9.5. The task is intentionally set up to require students to "figure out how to enable" the answer box, emphasizing problem-solving and attention to detail rather than simply providing a pre-defined input field. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f2001630]** This image shows a graded assignment question from a TDS (Team Data Science) course focusing on Large Language Models, specifically OpenAI's GPT-4o-Mini. The question challenges students to construct the correct JSON body for an OpenAI chat completion request, without actually running the API call, by adhering to specified constraints. RapidRoute Solutions is presented as the context: a logistics company generating realistic addresses via LLMs. Key requirements include using the `gpt-4o-mini` model, a system message to respond in JSON, a user message to generate 10 random US addresses, structured outputs with required fields (apartment, zip, latitude), and setting `additionalProperties` to `false`. The student notes that there's no text input box to provide the answer, indicating the exercise involves figuring out how to enable the input field, which is part of the test. The student can use the check button to see if their answer is correct. 2x" data-dominant-color="D0DBDA">image1920Ã—1080 305 KB
