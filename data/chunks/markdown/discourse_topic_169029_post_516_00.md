## Post #516 by 24f1002359

**Direct Link**: [Post #516](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/169029/516)

I noticed that my Project 2 status is currently marked as “Absent” in the course dashboard. However, I would like to clarify that I **submitted the GitHub repository and Vercel API link well before the deadline

via the designated forum.

Additionally, my **Vercel server is still active**, and the API is functioning correctly, which can be verified here:

API Form Submission

I also have a **response copy from the forum confirming my submission**, including both the GitHub and Vercel links, as proof. I kindly request you to review this and take the necessary steps to update my project status.
