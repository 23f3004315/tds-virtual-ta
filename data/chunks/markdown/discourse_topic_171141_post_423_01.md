**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image depicts a student's troubleshooting process in a terminal window while working on a TDS project, specifically related to Docker. The student first lists Docker images and filters the output to find an image with the ID "22f3002902". Next, the student attempts to run a Docker container using `docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 c739ff8a3247`, but encounters an error: "python: can't open file '/app/app/main.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory". This indicates that the `main.py` file, expected within the Docker container at the specified path, is missing or not accessible, suggesting a potential issue with the Docker image's build process or directory structure. The student is working within the `/mnt/sdb/github_approach` directory of their TDS course environment.` is missing within the container's filesystem or the container's working directory is not correctly set, which prevents the application from starting. The root cause seems to be a file path issue within the Docker container configuration, suggesting that the container is either not being built correctly or the run command expects a file structure that doesn't exist inside the container." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="rEDhJXcG5IlxU7DRnlQ7T7u0QIh" width="690" height="149" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image captures a student's technical issue within the TDS course project environment, specifically related to running a Docker container. The student first lists Docker images and filters the output to find an image with ID "22f3002902". Next, the student attempts to run a Docker container using `docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 c739ff8a3247`. This command results in a "python: can't open file '/app/app/main.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory" error, suggesting that the `main.py` file is not found within the container's `/app/app/` directory. This indicates a potential issue with the Docker image's file structure or the student's execution environment setup. The error highlights a common problem of incorrect file paths or missing files when running Docker containers., **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image is part of a student's troubleshooting process within a course discussion, specifically showing a terminal output related to Docker execution. The student first runs `docker images | grep "22f3002902"` to confirm the presence of a particular Docker image, identifying it as `22f3002902`. They then attempt to run the Docker image with `docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 c739ff8a3247`, but encounter an error: "python: can't open file '/app/app/main.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory". This indicates the Python script `main.py` within the container is not found at the expected path, pointing to a potential problem with the Docker image's internal file structure or the working directory settings used during execution. The student's confusion stems from the image failing to locate and run the necessary Python script. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image captures a student encountering an error while running a Docker container, indicative of a troubleshooting scenario within a peer discussion or student question context. The student is in the `/mnt/sdb/github_approach` directory and first lists Docker images, filtering for `"22f3002902"`. Next, the student attempts to run a Docker container with image ID `c739ff8a3247`, mapping port 8000 and passing an `AIPROXY_TOKEN` as an environment variable. The error message "python: can't open file '/app/app/main.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory" suggests that the Python script `/app/app/main.py` is not found within the container's file system, possibly due to a misconfiguration in the Dockerfile or incorrect mounting of volumes, indicating the student's confusion regarding the file paths within the Docker environment. This error also serves as a learning opportunity for understanding Docker file systems and debugging application paths. 2x" data-dominant-color="171717">image1823Ã—395 24.4 KB
