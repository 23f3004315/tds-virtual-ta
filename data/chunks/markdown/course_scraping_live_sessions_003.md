The image suggests the live session provides dynamic content to scrape, as attendees can join and leave, requiring real-time or near real-time data capture techniques.)](https://youtu.be/DryMIxMf3VU)

XML intro and scraping

---

[**[Course Image: XML intro and scraping]** This image sets the stage for learning about XML and scraping within the TDS curriculum, showing several browser tabs open including one for XML examples and another for w3schools XML tutorials, implying a starting point of learning the basics of XML structure and syntax before attempting to scrape it. The presence of other tabs like "Python I 24" and "Python Textbook" indicates that Python will likely be the language used for scraping XML data. Students are expected to gain the skills to parse and extract relevant information from XML documents using Python, applicable to various TDS projects involving data retrieval. Common misconceptions about XML structure and proper parsing techniques will likely be addressed as the course progresses. XML and its relevance to web scraping, specifically within the context of "scraping-live-sessions." It showcases several browser tabs open, including a Meet session ("Meet-yjx-bam-akh"), "XML Examples," and "w3schools.com/xml/note," suggesting that the learner will be using W3Schools as a resource for learning XML structure. Another tab "Best XML Viewer" implies that the student will explore tools for viewing and understanding XML data which is crucial for scraping. The shortcuts visible hint at resources like a Python textbook and project documents, indicating Python's role in parsing the scraped XML data. Mastering XML fundamentals is a prerequisite for effectively extracting and utilizing information from websites serving data in XML format during live scraping sessions.)](https://youtu.be/8S_jvsjtaYg)
