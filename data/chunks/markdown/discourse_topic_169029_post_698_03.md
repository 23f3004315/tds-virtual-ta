**[Discussion Image by 23f1001231]** This image provides guidance on how to interact with the TDS Solver API using `curl`. It describes that the application exposes an API endpoint at `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/` and accepts POST requests with the question and optional file attachments as `multipart/form-data`. The image then shows an example `curl` command for sending a POST request with the question "Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is t" and a file named "abcd.zip". The `Content-Type` header is set to `multipart/form-data`. The example uses the `-F` option to send the question as a form field and the `@` symbol to indicate that `abcd.zip` should be uploaded as a file. This is instructional content from a TDS course discussion thread, showing example API usage and addressing potential student questions about how to format requests.s students understand the API's expected input format and provides a functional `curl` command for testing." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="rDbNg0W387ZSShx1ldhYUeeEu2D" width="690" height="285" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1001231]** This image captures an instructor's explanation regarding how to interact with the application's API endpoint for the TDS Solver project. The instructor specifies that the API endpoint, hypothetically located at `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`, accepts POST requests containing the question and optional file attachments in `multipart/form-data` format. As an example, the instructor provides a `curl` command demonstrating how to send a POST request to the API endpoint, including a "question" parameter and attaching the "abcd.zip" file. The command shown is `curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \ -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \ -F "question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is t -F "file=@abcd.zip"`., **[Discussion Image by 23f1001231]** This image shows instructional content within a TDS student discussion thread regarding Project 2, specifically the TDS Solver. It details how to make a POST request to the application's API endpoint using `curl`. The instructions highlight that the endpoint should accept the question and optional file attachments as `multipart/form-data`, providing a concrete `curl` command example including setting the `Content-Type` header and using the `-F` option to send the question and file. The example `curl` command includes the question and a file named `abcd.zip` indicating how to send a zipped file with the request. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1001231]** This image shows an instructor's answer in the TDS student discussion thread regarding Project 2, providing guidance on how to make a request to the API endpoint. The instructor specifies that the application exposes an API endpoint at "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" which must accept POST requests with the question and optional file attachments as multipart/form-data. A curl command is provided as an example, including options for specifying the request method (-X POST), the content type (-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"), the question text (-F "question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is t"), and the file to upload (-F "file=@abcd.zip"). This example aims to clarify how to structure the API request for both text questions and file uploads within the project. 2x" data-dominant-color="2B3439">image1065Ã—440 42.5 KB
