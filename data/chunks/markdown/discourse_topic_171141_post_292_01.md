**[Discussion Image by Srishty_Snehi]** This image captures an automated email response from the TDS (The Data Science) Team regarding Project 1 prerequisite evaluations, indicating that the student's submission will not be evaluated because it fails to meet the minimum requirements. The email outlines five requirements: accessible GitHub repository with an MIT license, a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image running via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`, and consistent Dockerfiles between the image and the GitHub repository. The evaluation results show that the Docker image is present and public in Docker Hub, but the GitHub repository is failing to be present and public, and the Dockerfile and MIT license are not found in the root of the GitHub repository, leading to a "FAIL" status and a Project 1 score of 0. This feedback informs the student that they need to ensure their GitHub repository is publicly accessible and contains the required Dockerfile and MIT license in its root directory to meet the project prerequisites. The email is an automated message, directing students to contact the course team via Discourse for further assistance.ren't met.

The email outlines five prerequisites for project evaluation, including having a valid Dockerfile, running the Docker image with the `podman run` command `AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` and the necessity of a LICENSE file with the MIT license. Because the student failed the github repo and license prequisites, the overall "Prerequisites" evaluation is marked as "FAIL" and the Project 1 Score is 0. The email emphasizes that failure to meet the minimum requirements will prevent project evaluation, and also notes that the email is an official announcement and that further assistance can be found on Discourse., **[Discussion Image by Srishty_Snehi]** This image represents an automated email from the TDS Team providing feedback on Project 1 prerequisites. The email details specific requirements such as having a LICENSE file, a valid Dockerfile, and ensuring the Docker image is publicly accessible. The email indicates that the student's Docker image is present and public on Docker Hub (PASS), but the GitHub repository is failing to be present and public (FAIL), along with the Dockerfile and MIT license missing from the root of the GitHub repo (FAIL for both). As a result, the overall prerequisites are marked as FAIL, and the project score is 0, signifying the submission will not be evaluated until these issues are resolved, requiring the student to verify these files exist and are publicly accessible on their github repo's root. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Srishty_Snehi]** This image shows an automated email from the TDS team providing feedback on Project 1 prerequisites. The email outlines the requirements, including a public GitHub repository with a LICENSE file and a Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image. The email indicates that while the Docker image is present and public, the GitHub repository is failing because it's not public, and both the Dockerfile and MIT license are not found in the root of the GitHub repository. As a result, the student's prerequisites are marked as FAIL, and their Project 1 score is 0. The email specifies `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` as the command to run the Docker image. 2x" data-dominant-color="23241C">Screenshot_2025-04-05-18-51-43-721_com.google.android.gm1080Ã—2400 144 KB
