Hello Gentlemen Instructors,

In all the video lectures, I am first required to download the tools, install them on my computer ? Is it not going to overload my computerâ€™s RAM etc.,

In one of the classes, you said that there is something - colab like cloud wherein we can go and practice without overloading our own computers. Will you please let me know how to go about it ??

Thanks and regards,

ULAGAOOZHIAN,

France
