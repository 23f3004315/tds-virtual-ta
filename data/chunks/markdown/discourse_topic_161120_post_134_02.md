**[Discussion Image by 23f3004114]** The image shows a student's attempt to solve a Graded Assignment 2 (GA2) deployment task, specifically related to filtering student data based on class. The student is testing their API endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`) with query parameters (`?class=`) to retrieve students from specified classes. The "Error: Response undefined does not match expected" indicates a discrepancy between the API's actual response and the expected output. The student is using the browser's Network tab to inspect the API response, shown in the Preview section, revealing a JSON structure containing student IDs and class information. The specific URL used for testing in the Network tab is `/api?class=1N&class=BN&class=8X&class=42`. The task description emphasizes returning students in the same order as they appear in the CSV file. The student seems to be struggling with the correct format or logic to return the precise expected data for the test case involving multiple class filters. shows a list of students with their student IDs and class assignments, and the student needs to identify why the actual response doesn't match the expected output. This looks like a student is getting the filtering logic wrong within the FastAPI endpoint." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-01 at 6.13.02 PM" data-base62-sha1="76QIJSjwnoStbcGn9WikTLZSHUc" width="690" height="431" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f3004114]** This image shows a student's attempt to validate their API endpoint for a coding assignment, specifically the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" assignment. The student's attempt to validate their API using a URL with multiple class parameters (class=IN&class=8N&class=8X&class=42) resulted in an error, indicating that the response does not match the expected JSON format. The error message shows a mismatch between the returned and expected "studentid" and "class" combinations. Below the validation interface, the Chrome Developer Tools "Network" tab displays the details of the API calls, including Headers, Payload, Preview and Response for the attempted URL; the preview shows key-value pairs of student ID's and class names that are being returned from the API endpoint. The instructions require the API to return students in the same order as they appear in the CSV file, and CORS must be enabled., **[Discussion Image by 23f3004114]** The image captures a student's struggle with a Graded Assignment in a TDS (Training Data Science) course, specifically regarding the GA2 - Deployment Tools. The student is attempting to pass the automated tests for an API that filters students based on class. The error message "Response undefined does not match expected [...]" indicates that the API response is not matching the expected JSON data when a query parameter "class" is added to the URL (e.g., "?class=1N&class=8N&class=8X&class=4Z"). The image also displays the Chrome Developer Tools, Network tab, showing the API requests and responses. The preview pane shows the actual JSON response returned by the API. The student needs to debug their API implementation to ensure it correctly filters and returns the expected student data for the given class query parameters, also ensuring CORS is enabled for GET requests from any origin. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f3004114]** This image captures a student's attempt to validate their API endpoint for the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" assignment, specifically related to filtering students by class. The assignment instructions state that the API, when provided with a "class" query parameter (e.g., `/api?class=1A`), should return only students from the specified class(es) in the order they appear in the CSV file. The student is using the provided API endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` and has likely submitted their solution to the autograder.
