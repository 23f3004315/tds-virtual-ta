**[Discussion Image by 21f3002277]** This image depicts a student encountering a `ModuleNotFoundError` while running the `evaluate.py` script for TDS Project 1, indicating a missing Python module named 'datagen'. The error occurs during the execution of the script loaded via `uv run` from a raw GitHub URL, specifically on line 20 where the `datagen` module is imported. The student is running the command `OPENAI_API_KEY=$AIPROXY_TOKEN uv run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanando/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/evaluate.py` in their terminal within the directory `/mnt/e/IITM/New/TDS/LLM_Project`. This suggests that the `datagen` module is either not installed or not accessible in the Python environment where the script is being executed. To resolve this, the student needs to install the `datagen` module, likely via `pip install datagen` or a similar package management command, or ensure it's available within the active environment.rary, required by the script, is not installed in the environment. The traceback shows the error originated from line 20 of a temporary file, where the `datagen` module is imported. The student is attempting to run the code using `uv run` with a URL pointing to a raw GitHub file. This suggests a potential installation issue or an incorrect setup of the Python environment required for the project, likely an overlooked dependency." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="sZigWPfeWhRLDPlQWlHX2QUBClw" width="690" height="237" data-dominant-color="1B1A1B">image1425Ã—490 11.1 KB
