**[Discussion Image by 23f2003717]** This image depicts a snippet of a data table being discussed in a TDS student discussion thread related to "GA5 - Data Preparation". It shows a dataset with columns "Country (Normalised)", "DATE", "Product", "Sales", and "Cost", with data entries for the "United Arab Emirates" and the product "Kappa." The columns have filter icons suggesting that the data can be filtered by different categories. The student is likely inquiring or illustrating a point related to data cleaning or transformation within this context.le columns are "Country (Normalized)", "DATE", "Product", "Sales", and "Cost", and the data appears to be related to sales of the product "Kappa" in the United Arab Emirates across various dates. The DATE column shows dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, while the Sales and Cost columns show numeric values with two decimal places. The filter icon is active on the DATE column. This might represent a student sharing a sample of their data or asking a question about data cleaning or transformation related to these columns, and it serves as a reference point for instructors or peers to understand the student's issue and provide targeted help during the Data Preparation module." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="agmwf6QvAh9KaDXo2bSehEAfeqi" width="690" height="123" data-dominant-color="AFC1D5">image987Ã—176 14.4 KB
