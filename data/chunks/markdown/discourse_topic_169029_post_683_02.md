**[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image is a screenshot from a student's debugging process of Project 2, specifically the TDS Solver, and shows a successful API call using a tool like Postman or Insomnia. The student is using a POST request to the `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` endpoint, sending data as form-data including a `question` which is the prompt and a file named `abcd.zip`. The zip file was updated with a new CSV file containing a different value, and as a result, the JSON response body displays the expected answer `{"answer": "3812934199"}`, which indicates that the student has successfully troubleshooted and received the correct output from the API. The interface elements like "Params", "Authorization", "Headers", "Body", "Scripts", and "Settings" are visible, further confirming the use of an API testing tool. This post illustrates successful problem-solving in the TDS Solver project by updating input data and verifying the correct API response.and the JSON response viewer showing the extracted 'answer' value, indicating successful execution and problem resolution. This demonstrates how to structure the API request with the required parameters to get the correct answer from the TDS Solver project." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="zulTPhDfgFBFkwNcWLZiFgEXffG" width="690" height="324" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image shows a student demonstrating successful execution of the TDS solver for Project 2. The student is using a POST request to the endpoint `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`. The request body is in `form-data` format, containing a "question" field with the value "What is the value in the 'answer' column of the..." and a "file" field with the value "abcd.zip." The student updated the zip file with a new CSV file containing a different "answer" value. The response body, shown in JSON format, contains the expected "answer": "3812934199". The response indicates a "200 OK" status, confirming a successful request., **[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image depicts a student's successful interaction with the TDS solver API using Postman, demonstrating a peer discussion point of validating successful outcomes by comparing different diff values in the provided CSV file. The student made a POST request to `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` with form-data including the 'question' key set to "What is the value in the 'answer' column of the ..." and the 'file' key set to "abcd.zip", where they had updated the zip file with a new CSV file containing a different value. After sending the request, the student received a 200 OK response and a JSON payload, `{"answer": "3812934199"}`, indicating that the API correctly extracted the expected answer from the updated CSV file within the zip file, and considered the result an expected one. The warning triangle on the `abcd.zip` suggests it may contain errors. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image captures a student successfully using Postman to interact with the TDS solver API endpoint. The student is sending a POST request to `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` with "form-data" encoding, including a 'question' parameter with the value "What is the value in the 'answer' column of the..." and a 'file' parameter pointing to the 'abcd.zip' file. The student updated the zip file with a new CSV file to test a different value and received a 200 OK response with the expected answer "3812934199" in the JSON response body. The arrow annotations highlight the zip file selection and the received answer value. 2x" data-dominant-color="F9F8F8">image1936×910 128 KB
