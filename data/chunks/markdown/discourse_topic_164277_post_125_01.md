NEED HELP. CAN SOMEONE CONTACT OLLAMA AND ASK THEM TO CHECK THEIR CODE ITS HAS SOME SILLY MISTAKES IN CODE EXAMPLES. I DONT KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

**[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image shows instructional content for the "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent" discussion thread, guiding students on how to store documents in a vector embedding database and retrieve relevant documents using the Ollama embedding model. The first code snippet iterates through a list of documents, generates embeddings using `ollama.embed` with the "mxbai-embed-large" model, and adds the embeddings, IDs, and documents to a collection using `collection.add`. The second code snippet demonstrates retrieving the most relevant document by first embedding a user input prompt ("What animals are llamas related to?") using `ollama.embed` and then querying the collection using `collection.query` with the generated embedding and a specified number of results (n_results=1), extracting the document from the results. This content provides step-by-step instructions for performing vector database operations and using embeddings to retrieve relevant information, suggesting a learning guide from the course instructor.abase using `ollama.embed` and retrieving the most relevant document given an example prompt. The first code snippet iterates through documents, generates embeddings using the "mxbai-embed-large" model, and adds them to a collection. The second snippet shows how to retrieve a document by embedding an example input ("What animals are llamas related to?") and querying the collection, extracting the relevant document from the query results. The student may be having issues implementing these steps, as this post is part of a larger discussion thread." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-11 232608" data-base62-sha1="5F1hzxksDi54nBGls5d6m6F2hyu" width="643" height="499" data-dominant-color="F3F3F3">Screenshot 2025-02-11 232608919Ã—714 22.4 KB
