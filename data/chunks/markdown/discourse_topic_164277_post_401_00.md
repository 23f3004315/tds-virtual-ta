## Post #401 by Kabir1203

**Direct Link**: [Post #401](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/164277/401)

when I run the evaluation file, i get the following error - Running task: Install `uv` (if required) and run the script `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/datagen.py` with `user@example.com` as the only argument A1 failed: All connection attempts failed A1 FAILED

I am getting the following error when running the evaluation scripts, can someone help me understand what this error is?
