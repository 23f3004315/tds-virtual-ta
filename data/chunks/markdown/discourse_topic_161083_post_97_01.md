= 1235 bytes and modification date >= Nov 6, 2019, 10:48 AM IST). The student initially entered "507182" as the answer, which was marked incorrect. The question provides a hint suggesting the student should use utilities like `unzip` or 7-Zip to extract the files, as Windows Explorer can alter file timestamps. The PowerShell commands used by the student, including `Get-ChildItem`, `Where-Object`, and `Measure-Object`, are visible in the terminal output. Also shown is a FOR loop. The student appears to be having timestamp issues or an incorrect sum calculation when using Powershell, which impacts the final answer." data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/bGs1tmdd72KIQwfbrZwLuHW1dlf.png?dl=1" title="Untitled design" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** The image depicts a student's attempt to solve the "List files and attributes" task in the TDS Jan 2025 course, showcasing both the student's PowerShell commands and an error message from the autograder. The task requires listing all files in a folder with their date and file size, then determining the total size (in bytes) of files at least 1235 bytes large and modified on or after Wed, 6 Nov 2019, 10:48 AM IST. The student ran PowerShell commands using `Get-ChildItem` with `Where-Object` to filter files based on length and LastWriteTime, calculating the sum of the length property, but the student receives an "Incorrect. Try again" error message on submitting the answer `507162` to the question, indicating a possible issue with the PowerShell command, the timestamp handling, or the unzipping method since the prompt advises against using Windows Explorer. The prompt also specifically suggests to extract the files using `7-zip` or similar utilities, reinforcing the importance of preserving timestamps correctly.o unzip can destroy the timestamps. The PowerShell commands used by the student are visible, listing files with attributes using `Get-ChildItem` and filtering based on file length and last modification time, finally summing the `length` property." alt="Untitled design" data-base62-sha1="bGs1tmdd72KIQwfbrZwLuHW1dlf" width="353" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image captures a student's attempt to solve the "List files and attributes" assignment within the TDS Jan 2025 course, which involves listing files and their attributes in a given directory using command-line tools. The student downloaded a "list_files_attributes.zip" file containing a ".cl" script, and the task requires calculating the total size of files at least 1235 bytes large and modified on or after Wed, 6 Nov, 2019, 10:48 AM IST. The image shows the student executing a PowerShell command to get file information, filtering based on file size and last modification time, and then summing the lengths. The student's initial submission "507162" was marked as incorrect, with the prompt advising against extracting directly from the ZIP file or using Windows Explorer due to potential timestamp alteration, suggesting the use of uncia.7.zip or similar utilities to preserve timestamps., **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image captures a student's attempt to answer a question in the "GA1 - Development Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]" about listing file attributes. The question asks for the total size of files at least 1235 bytes large and modified on or after November 6, 2019. The student downloaded a "q-list-files-attributes.zip" file and extracted it, attempting to calculate the total size. The PowerShell command used includes `Get-ChildItem -Path . -File | Where-Object {$_.length -ge 1235 -and $_.LastWriteTime -ge '11/06/2019 10:48:00'} | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum`, aiming to filter files by size and modification date before summing their lengths; however, the response "507182" was marked as incorrect. A hint advises against using Windows Explorer to unzip, suggesting tools like `unzip` or `7-zip` to preserve file timestamps. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image shows a student attempting a task from a TDS (The Developer School) course related to development tools where they are asked to find the total size of files meeting specific criteria (size >= 1235 bytes and modified on/after Nov 6, 2019). The student has downloaded and extracted a zip file "q-list-files-attributes.zip" and is using PowerShell commands to analyze the extracted files. The image shows the student has attempted the question, entering the answer "507182", but received an "Incorrect. Try again." message indicating their solution is wrong. The screenshot of the PowerShell window shows commands used to list file attributes, filter based on size and lastwritetime, and calculate the sum of the file sizes. The student has entered the command: `powershell -Command "& { Get-ChildItem -Path . -File | Where-Object { $_.Length -ge 1235 -and $_.LastWriteTime -ge '11/06/2019 10:48:00' } | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum }"`. A warning message on the question indicates that timestamp issues can occur when extracting files improperly, directing them to use `unzip`, `7-Zip` or similar utilities to preserve timestamps, and to check the timestamps. 2x" data-dominant-color="9F9E9E">Untitled design1414Ã—2000 349 KB
