 with SQLite databases through a command-line interface or a graphical tool, allowing them to manage data for smaller applications or projects. Knowledge of basic SQL concepts would be helpful before diving into this introduction. A key takeaway will be understanding how SQLite differs from other database management systems in its architecture and use cases.)](https://youtu.be/8Xyn8R9eKB8)

[**[Course Image: SQLite Backend for Beginners - Create Quick Databases with Python and SQL (13 min)]** This image introduces SQLite as a database solution for beginners. SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine, and this module will guide you through using it effectively. You will learn how to create and manage databases using SQLite within your Python projects. Understanding SQLite will allow you to work with structured data, making your applications more robust. This knowledge is especially useful for projects requiring local data storage, data analysis, and prototyping applications.on to using SQLite for database management, particularly for beginners interested in creating quick databases with Python and SQL. The focus is on SQLite as a database solution, emphasizing its ease of use for creating and managing databases. Expect to learn the fundamentals of setting up and interacting with SQLite databases using Python. This will include creating database files, defining tables, and executing SQL commands for data manipulation. After completing this section, you should be able to create simple database applications using Python and SQLite.)](https://youtu.be/Ohj-CqALrwk)

There are many non-relational databases (NoSQL) like [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/), [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/), etc. that you should know about and we may cover later.

Core Concepts:

```sql
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE users (
 id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
 name TEXT NOT NULL,
 email TEXT UNIQUE,
 created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES
 ('Alice', 'alice@example.com'),
 ('Bob', 'bob@example.com');

-- Query data
SELECT name, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY name
HAVING count > 1;

-- Join tables
SELECT u.name, o.product
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE o.status = 'pending';
```

Python Integration:

```python
import sqlite3
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd

async def query_database(db_path: Path, query: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
 """Execute SQL query and return results as DataFrame.

Args:
 db_path: Path to SQLite database
 query: SQL query to execute
