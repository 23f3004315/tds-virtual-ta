**[Discussion Image by 23f2000573]** This image captures a student's interaction with the Docker command line, showing the execution of a Docker container and its output. The student, identified as "23f2000573," is attempting to run a Docker image named "23f2000573/first-rep:v1" using the command "docker run 23f2000573/first-rep:v1". The output of this command within the container is simply "abc.py", suggesting that this Python script was successfully executed as part of the container's startup or entry point. This represents a student showcasing successful deployment, although potentially simplified for demonstration purposes. The command prompt "giri@GIRI:~$ " indicates the user's local environment before running the Docker command.ecuting the command, the output "abc.py" is displayed, indicating that the Python script `abc.py` was executed within the container. This suggests the student successfully deployed and ran their image, and that the `abc.py` script was the entrypoint or part of the execution flow within the Docker container. The `giri@GIRI` prompt indicates the user's local environment. This provides a successful example of running a Docker image within a student's environment." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="2O0v803FEcalhPXnCfAvXuF25xx" width="690" height="61" data-dominant-color="442239">
