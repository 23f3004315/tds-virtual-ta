The 2 other log files i’m given doesnt have my email inside it listed.

We are aware about it results for 12 students are not generated, we will look into it, and see what caused those 12 images not to run.

My evaluation log file is missing in report provided. It says tasksA was not found. but I have submitted tasksA in my project file. Also it says server didnt start for 5 mins but for me image was working fine. please kindly help me out. I have made submissions correctly.

It would have run at your end but it was supposed to run at anywhere, after dockerising it didn’t run, reason is taskA module was not found.
