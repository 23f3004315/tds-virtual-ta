**[Discussion Image by Adithya]** This image is from a student discussion on deployment tools and displays JSON data output in a browser window, likely from a local server running at 127.0.0.1. The student is presenting a JSON payload containing a "students" array, where each student object includes "studentId" (an integer) and "class" (string value "1A") fields. The data structure is represented as: `{"students":[{"studentId":34,"class":"1A"},{"studentId":453, "class":"1A"},{"studentId":551, "class":"1"},{"studentId":829, "class":"1A"},{"stude ("studentId":1309, "class":"1"},{"studentId":1795,"class":"1A"}]}`. The post is likely a question regarding the format and validity of the JSON output, possibly related to data retrieval or API endpoint testing during the deployment process. A possible problem is the format of the student ID 551 and the missing quotes for the key value pair after "stude". Future students encountering similar issues can use this context for debugging their JSON outputs, especially when working with API endpoints and data serialization.1ILZ5zNUR5Woz9vz9H1pXtMRnPN" width="690" height="58" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Adithya]** This image shows a student's question in a TDS (Tools in Data Science) discussion thread on deployment tools, specifically about a JSON formatting issue related to the student's API output. The code snippet shows a JSON response with a "students" key containing an array of objects, each representing a student with "studentId" and "class" attributes. A student sees the raw JSON output in their browser tab at address "127.0.0.1", implying they have an API running locally. A possible question is related to the formatting of the JSON output where each student object has key-value pairs for "studentID" and "class" and they are not sure if it is acceptable., **[Discussion Image by Adithya]** This image depicts a student post in the "GA2 - Deployment Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]" on a tool course. It shows the JSON data being returned from a local server, accessible at the URL "127.0.0.1". The JSON structure represents an object with a "students" key, which contains an array of student objects; each student object has "studentId" and "class" properties, such as {"studentId":34,"class":"1A"}. This suggests the student is likely showcasing the successful retrieval of data from their local deployment, potentially as part of demonstrating a completed task. The student aims to show a structured data output with student identifiers and class information. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Adithya]** This image represents a student post on a discussion thread about deployment tools, likely showing the result of an API call or data retrieval within a web browser. The browser tab is displaying JSON data retrieved from `127.0.0.1`, indicating it's probably a locally hosted server or API endpoint being tested. The JSON payload shows a "students" array, where each student object has "studentId" and "class" fields, such as `{"studentId":34,"class":"1A"}`. This suggests the student is working with structured student data and potentially validating the data returned from the server-side application deployed. This confirms the server-side application or local server is functioning and returning student records as intended, helping the student confirm the initial deployment and data retrieval stage. 2x" data-dominant-color="333333">22234×188 34.4 KB
