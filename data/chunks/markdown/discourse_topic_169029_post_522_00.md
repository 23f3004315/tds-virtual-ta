## Post #522 by bhavanagv

**Direct Link**: [Post #522](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/169029/522)

Dear Sir, @carlton @Jivraj

I need your immediate attention regarding my **project-2 , as I received zero marks,** but **my server is running completely fine**. Below are the key points that I need you to look into:

Server is running and reachable. and Giving The Correct Answers

GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code, both return 200 OK.

Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people – all received correct results.

No issues seen in logs or deployment – everything was set up properly.

Others in my group got full marks – we worked on the same project.

I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation.

I’ve spent weeks working on this project, including sleepless nights.

Cant have least scores despite all the efforts.

Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify:

API Documentation: FastAPI - Swagger UI

I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that.

I’ve put in a lot of effort into this, and I sincerely request that you review it again.

Please don’t ignore this.

Thanks,

Bhavana G V
