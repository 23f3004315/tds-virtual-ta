0.219: 248985". This shows a student's success in processing an image, calculating lightness values, and conducting a pixel count based on a defined threshold." data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/A1I23IFTO0e9CDtcwYljSvQPQFW.png?dl=1" title="image" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">**[Discussion Image by daksh76]** This image shows a successful execution of Python code in a Google Colab environment, demonstrating image processing using the PIL (Pillow), NumPy, and colorsys libraries. The code imports necessary libraries, uploads an image file named "lenna.webp" using `files.upload()`, and opens the image. The image is then converted to a NumPy array, pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1], and the lightness of each pixel is calculated using `colorsys.rgb_to_hls`. Finally, the code counts the number of pixels with a lightness value greater than or equal to 0.219 and prints the result: "Number of pixels with lightness > 0.219: 248985". The file upload process and the successful count are displayed in the output area.nna.webp' and calculate the number of pixels with lightness greater than 0.219. The code imports necessary libraries like numpy, PIL (Pillow), google.colab.files, and colorsys. It uploads the image, converts it to an RGB array, calculates lightness using `colorsys.rgb_to_hls`, and counts the number of pixels meeting the lightness threshold, printing the final count which is 248985. This indicates successful execution of the code and a peer discussion contribution." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="A1I23IFTO0e9CDtcwYljSvQPQFW" width="690" height="360" data-dominant-color="303030">image857Ã—448 25.8 KB
