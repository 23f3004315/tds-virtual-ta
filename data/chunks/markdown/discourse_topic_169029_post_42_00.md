**[Discussion Image by 23f2004793]** This image shows instructions from an instructor within a TDS student discussion about Project 2, the TDS Solver. It specifies that the application should expose an API endpoint at `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`. Further, it clarifies that the endpoint must accept POST requests, exemplified by `POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`, with the question being passed, and that optional file attachments should be handled as `multipart/form-data`. These instructions provide specific technical guidance for implementing the API endpoint in the project., hypothetically located at `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`. This endpoint is required to handle POST requests, including the question being submitted and optionally allowing file attachments using `multipart/form-data`. The `POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/` example shown emphasizes how data should be sent to the API. This likely clarifies how students should design their API to correctly receive data for processing." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="1IxLrSUpzfsKi7imUdGbTGb2tOc" width="690" height="99" data-dominant-color="354046">image1010Ã—145 13.6 KB
