 allow. If you use `*`, anyone can access the application. It's better to restrict access by listing specific servers. For example, if you only want to allow access from `server1` and `server2`, you would list them. You only need to mention the domain name.

**Q11: I'm stuck on the Docker part of the assignment.**

---

**A11:** Let's review the Docker process. You need to create a Docker image and push it. The deliverables are the Git repo and the Docker image. It should be a public repository.

**Q12: I'm having trouble with the FastAPI part of the assignment. I'm trying to send a POST request to a specific endpoint, but it's not working.**

**A12:** Let's review the code. You'll need to automate the process using an LLM. The LLM will generate the code, which you'll then execute using the subprocess module in Python.

**Q13: Why do we need to use the subprocess module?**

**A13:** In this project, you'll receive tasks in different languages (English, Hindi, Urdu). The LLM will generate the code to handle these tasks. The subprocess module allows you to execute the generated code on your local machine.

**Q14: I have a question about the Base64 encoding in GA3, question 6. I converted an image to Base64 using Python, but the UI said it was wrong. I found another method, but how do I know which Base64 encoding is correct?**

**A14:** If you paste the Base64 encoding into a decoder, you can visually compare the resulting image to the original. The size and resolution should be the same.

**Q15: Some of my answers from previous assignments disappeared after logging out of the website. Why?**

**A15:** That's a known issue. Some answers persist, but others are lost.

**Q16: Can I still check the answers to previous assignments, even though the deadline has passed?**

**A16:** Officially, no. However, if you can check the answers, you can learn from your mistakes.

**Q17: I got stuck on the Docker part of the assignment. Can you elaborate?**

**A17:** It sounds like you may have had issues with Docker push and tagging. Let's review your process.

**Q18: I only gave myself 5 hours for this assignment, which wasn't enough. GA2 took a lot of time, especially the last question (running a local server on a different API).**

**A18:** Five hours is often insufficient for these assignments. GA2, in particular, can be time-consuming.
