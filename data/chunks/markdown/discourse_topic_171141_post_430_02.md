 the working directory to /app, copies application files, exposes port 8000, and starts the FastAPI server. The use of "uv" for dependency management is notable. 2x" data-dominant-color="13171D">image1670×914 67.9 KB

**[Discussion Image by 23f1000879]** This image shows a student, 23f1000879, posting their Dockerfile in the TDS_Project_1 repository on GitHub for discussion in the "Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies" thread. The Dockerfile uses Python 3.12 slim as the base image and installs system dependencies and Python packages such as fastapi, uvicorn, scipy, and pandas. It also configures the application directory, copies the application files, exposes port 8000, and starts the FastAPI server using uvicorn. The student has hand-annotated "mine" pointing to the code, suggesting they are looking for feedback or confirmation that it is correct, possibly to compare it to an expected version. This is a peer review step as part of the project.ine" with an arrow pointing to the Dockerfile, indicating that it is their version of the file." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="6R7JPTABdp08gdr9D0UZsdUIota" width="690" height="468" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1000879]** This image shows a student, 23f1000879, sharing their Dockerfile for the "TDS_Project_1" project within a GitHub repository. The student has added a Dockerfile with instructions to set up a Python 3.12 environment, install system dependencies for SciPy, install the "uv" package manager, install Python packages such as fastapi, uvicorn, and others, set the PATH environment variable, set the working directory, copy application files, expose port 8000, and start the FastAPI server using uvicorn. The handwritten annotation "mine" with an arrow points to the code, indicating that this is the student's implementation of the Dockerfile being shared for discussion or comparison. The file is located at "TDS_Project_1/Dockerfile" in the repository, and the student wants to compare this to other files or an official solution. The student's Dockerfile provides the exact steps required to build and run the application in a containerized environment., **[Discussion Image by 23f1000879]** This image shows a student's Dockerfile from the TDS_Project_1 repository on GitHub, specifically posted by user 23f1000879 within the "Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies" discussion. The Dockerfile starts with specifying a base Python 3.12 slim image, then installs system dependencies and the `uv` tool. After that, it installs required Python packages using pip, sets the PATH environment variable, and sets the working directory to `/app`. Finally, it copies all application files into the app directory, exposes port 8000, and defines the command to start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn. A handwritten annotation "mine" with an arrow pointing at the code indicates the student is likely sharing their Dockerfile for reference or comparison within the discussion. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1000879]** This image depicts a student's Dockerfile, presumably for the "TDS_Project_1" assignment, shared in a discussion thread. The Dockerfile starts from a Python 3.12 slim base image and installs system dependencies for SciPy and other libraries. It also installs uv, followed by required Python packages such as fastapi, uvicorn, and others, using pip. The Dockerfile then sets the PATH, sets up the application directory, copies all application files, exposes port 8000, and defines the command to start the FastAPI server. A handwritten annotation "mine" points to the file, indicating it's the student's own Dockerfile. 2x" data-dominant-color="12161C">image1376×935 60.5 KB
