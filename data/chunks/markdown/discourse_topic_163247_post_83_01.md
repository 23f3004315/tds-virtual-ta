**[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image shows a student's attempt at completing a coding assignment in a discussion thread on Large Language Models. The task is to write a Python function `most_similar(embeddings)` that calculates the cosine similarity between pairs of embeddings and returns the two phrases with the highest similarity as a tuple. The student's initial code includes `import numpy`, a function definition with a placeholder comment `# Your code here`, and a `return` statement attempting to return `(phrase1, phrase2)`. The code generates a `NameError: name 'phrase1' is not defined` error, indicating that the variables `phrase1` and `phrase2` are not defined within the function scope before being returned, and the submission is marked as "Incorrect answer." The error traceback includes file paths to the execution environment `/lib/python312.zip/_pyodide/_base.py` showing the error occurred during code evaluation.nction body, indicating a logical error in the student's code. The interface shows an "Incorrect answer" message along with the Python traceback, implying an automated grading system is in use that flags the error." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-04 193342" data-base62-sha1="kYRS2XQf8rFptsmI9vs1QsYeppX" width="690" height="201" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image shows a student's attempt to write a Python function `most_similar(embeddings)` that calculates the cosine similarity between pairs of embeddings and returns the pair with the highest similarity as a tuple. The student has imported the `numpy` library and defined the function with a placeholder comment `# Your code here` and a return statement `return (phrase1, phrase2)`. The error "Incorrect answer" is displayed, along with a traceback indicating a `NameError: name 'phrase1' is not defined` because the variables `phrase1` and `phrase2` are used in the return statement without being defined or assigned values within the function. The student needs to implement the cosine similarity calculation and assign the appropriate phrase pairs to `phrase1` and `phrase2` before returning them., **[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image shows a student's attempt to complete a coding assignment, which involves writing a Python function `most_similar(embeddings)` to find the pair of phrases with the highest cosine similarity. The student has included `import numpy`, a function definition with a placeholder comment, and a `return (phrase1, phrase2)` statement. However, the code returns an "Incorrect answer" and a `NameError: name 'phrase1' is not defined` error. The error indicates that `phrase1` and `phrase2` are used in the return statement without being defined or assigned values within the function, reflecting a failure to properly implement the cosine similarity calculation and pair identification logic. The student needs to implement the core logic to calculate the cosine similarity between the embeddings and properly return the phrases, instead of the undefined variables. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image depicts a student's attempt to solve a Python coding problem related to calculating cosine similarity between embeddings, which appears to be an ungraded assessment (GA3) in a TDS (The Data Science) course. The student is tasked with writing a `most_similar(embeddings)` function that returns the pair of phrases with the highest similarity as a tuple. The student's code currently imports `numpy` and defines the function with a placeholder `# Your code here` and a `return (phrase1, phrase2)` statement. The execution of the code resulted in a `NameError: name 'phrase1' is not defined` error, indicating that the variables `phrase1` and `phrase2` were not defined within the function's scope before being returned. This suggests the student has not yet implemented the logic to calculate similarity and identify the most similar phrases within the input `embeddings`. 2x" data-dominant-color="2A2C30">Screenshot 2025-02-04 1933421670Ã—487 54.1 KB
