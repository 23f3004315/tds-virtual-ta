**[Discussion Image by 24f2006531]** This image shows a student submission and validation failure within a TDS "GA3 - Large Language Models" discussion. The student is prompted to enter the API URL endpoint for their implementation, with an example given as "http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity". The student enters "http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity", but this submission results in an error. The error message is a nonsensical, pre-programmed placeholder text about cybersecurity training and staff handbooks, indicating an issue with the input validation or a placeholder failure message, which is likely causing student confusion.t enters "http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity" as the API endpoint in the provided text box. An error message is displayed, indicating that the input "Got incorrect matches," followed by seemingly unrelated text about employee training, handbook updates, and quality assurance, suggesting that there is some form of automated validation in place that produced a humorous or misguided error message. It's likely that the server-side validation logic encountered a mismatch and returned a generic error instead of a helpful one." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="qgEJswA40abU1F4kZIL0sWUO3z5" width="690" height="73" data-dominant-color="2E2C30">image1288×138 7.33 KB
