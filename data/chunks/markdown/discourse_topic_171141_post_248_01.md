**[Discussion Image by 23f1001415]** This image shows an email received by a student from '22t1 se2002' regarding Project 1 prerequisites. The email outlines five prerequisites, including that the GitHub repository exists, has a LICENSE file with an MIT license, has a valid Dockerfile, that the Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via a specific podman command, and that the Docker image uses the same Dockerfile. The email indicates that the student's Docker image being present and public on Docker Hub passed the check but the GitHub repository's existence and public access, along with the presence of a Dockerfile and MIT license file in the root directory failed. This results in a failed prerequisites check and a Project 1 score of 0.

The email details the pre-requisites for Project 1, including the GitHub repository existing and being publicly accessible, having an MIT license, a Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image that runs via podman, and using the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository. The evaluation results indicate that the Docker image is present and public (PASS), but the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license are not (FAIL). Consequently, the student's prerequisites are marked as FAIL, resulting in a Project 1 score of 0. The student needs to address the failed checks related to their GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT License to pass the pre-requisites., **[Discussion Image by 23f1001415]** This image depicts an email received by the student 23f1001415@... from se2002@study.iitm.ac.in regarding the prerequisites evaluation for TDS Project 1. The email details five requirements including a public Github repository, a LICENSE file, a valid Dockerfile, Docker image accessibility, and Dockerfile consistency between the image and Github repository. The email then shows the student's evaluation results: Docker image passes, but the Github repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license checks have failed.

The email lists the prerequisites for Project 1 and the student's evaluation results, indicating several failures: Github repo not public, missing Dockerfile, and missing MIT license. The email details that the student needs a publicly accessible GitHub repository, a LICENSE file with the MIT license, and a valid Dockerfile in the root of the repository. Furthermore, it states the Docker image needs to be publicly accessible and runnable via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` and use the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repo. Because the prerequisites are not met, the student's Project 1 score is 0. 2x" data-dominant-color="DCDADC">Screenshot (390)1920Ã—1080 266 KB
