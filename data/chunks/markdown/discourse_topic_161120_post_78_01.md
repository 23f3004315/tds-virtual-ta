**[Discussion Image by 23f2003853]** The image shows a student's question and an error encountered when testing the FastAPI API endpoint. The student is aiming to implement a feature where a query parameter 'class' filters students by class. The instructor provides an example of the desired URL structure, `/api?class=1A&class=1B`. The student tests the `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` endpoint and encounters an error: "Response undefined does not match expected". The expected data, including student IDs and class names, are shown in a JSON format, revealing a discrepancy between the actual API response and the expected output when filtering by class. The student plans to add `?class=` and check if the response matches the intended data. The instructor also advised the student to make sure they enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin.ttp://127.0.0.1:8000/api`, attempting to use a class parameter to filter the student data returned. However, they are encountering an error: "Response undefined does not match expected...". The expected data is a JSON array of student objects, each containing a "studentid" and "class" field, but the actual response is undefined. The student plans to add `?class=` to the URL and then check if the response matches the data and ensure CORS is enabled to allow GET requests from any origin." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="A4Jp0jd7ysM6bpC12oXdbjPP0vh" width="602" height="222">image602Ã—222 67.7 KB
