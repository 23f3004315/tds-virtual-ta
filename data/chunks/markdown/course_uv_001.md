The eliminates the need for `requirements.txt` or virtual environments. For example:

```python

[**[Course Image: uv - Python package and project management | Inline Script Metadata (28 min)]** This image introduces "uv," a new ultra-fast Python package and project manager, designed to improve upon existing tools like pip. Understanding "uv" is essential as it streamlines the process of managing project dependencies, potentially speeding up development workflows in TDS projects. It's crucial to learn how to use "uv" effectively to build and manage Python projects efficiently. By adopting "uv", students can expect faster installation times and better dependency resolution, leading to more productive development experiences. The surrounding script context specifies that uv requires python version 3.11 or greater, along with the `httpx` and `pandas` dependencies.tra-fast Python package and project manager. It positions uv as a tool to streamline and accelerate package management tasks within Python projects. Students can expect to use "uv" for faster dependency resolution, installation, and overall project setup compared to traditional tools. Mastery of uv will enable students to optimize their Python development workflow in TDS projects. This builds upon foundational Python knowledge.)](https://youtu.be/igWlYl3asKw?t=1240)
