In this question, I am asked to find the total margin for transactions before **Tue, Jun 14, 2022, 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)** for **Theta** sold in **the US** (which may be spelled in different ways).

However, when I filter in Excel for **US** and **Theta**, there are no entries for **Sales** and **Cost**. But **0** as the answer is not accepted—it says the answer is incorrect.

(I cross-checked this using GPT.)
