 the necessary evaluation logs. The lack of files displayed suggests a problem with file extraction, directory placement, or potential file naming inconsistencies with the expected name, which requires further investigation. 2x" data-dominant-color="FDFDFD">image1083×528 8.42 KB

**[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image is a screenshot of a Google Sheet named "p1_evaluation_error_logs," showing a table of student submissions and their corresponding error reasons for Project 1. The table has columns for "email" (student ID) and "error_reason," with several entries indicating common issues such as missing modules ("requests module missing," "functions module missing," "app module missing," "taskA module missing," "flask_cors module missing," "phaseA module missing"), application running on the wrong port ("application running on 5000 port"), and shell script execution failures ("Usage: /app/start.sh ", "/bin/sh: 1: [/root/local/bin/uv,: not found"). Other errors include "SyntaxError: unmatched '\"'," "Error: Failed to spawn: 'app.py': Caused by: No such file or directory (os error 2)," and a container binding issue ("Container was bound to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 which is why docker container port 8000 is not accessible outside(host os)"). This appears to be used internally for project evaluation and is likely a reference for understanding recurring student errors.[/root/local/bin/uv: not found"), syntax errors ("SyntaxError: unmatched ']'"), missing files ("error: Failed to spawn: 'app.py'. Caused by: No such file or directory (os error 2)"), and container configuration problems ("Container was bound to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 which is why docker container port 8000 is not accessible outside(host os)"). The prevalence of "taskA module missing" suggests a specific component or task within Project 1 that many students struggled with. The image provides context for a student discussion, potentially centered on discrepancies or clarifications regarding these evaluation errors." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="rMjfMvzCYJHxo15IcaCSe5HYAUf" width="690" height="351" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image displays a spreadsheet, likely from Google Sheets, titled "p1_evaluation_error_logs." The spreadsheet has two columns: "email" (containing student email addresses) and "error_reason" (describing errors encountered during project evaluation). The "error_reason" column contains diverse error messages like "requests module missing," "application running on 5000 port," "functions module missing," "SyntaxError: unmatched '"'," "flask_cors module missing," and "Container was bound to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 which is why docker container port 8000 is not accessible outside(host os)." Many students received the error "taskA module missing," suggesting a common problem. The file is open in "View only" mode. This is a summary of student project issues used for debugging purposes and shows potential sources of errors., **[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image is from a TDS student discussion thread showing a Google Sheet named "p1_evaluation_error_logs". The sheet's columns include "email" and "error_reason", indicating this is likely an automated evaluation log of Project 1 submissions. The "error_reason" column lists a variety of issues such as "requests module missing," "application running on 5000 port," "functions module missing," "Usage: /app/start.sh ," missing modules ("app module," "whisper module," "taskA module," "phaseA module," "flask_cors module," "nest_asyncio module"), "SyntaxError: unmatched ']' ", a "file not found" error for 'app.py', and a container binding issue ("Container was bound to 127.0.0.1..."). This log is used to identify why student projects failed to run correctly during automated grading and helps students diagnose their code issues. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image shows a spreadsheet titled "p1_evaluation_error_logs" indicating an instructor providing feedback on student project submissions, specifically related to Project 1. The columns display student email addresses and corresponding error reasons encountered during automated evaluation, such as "requests module missing," "application running on 5000 port," "taskA module missing," "flask_cors module missing," and "phaseA module missing". Some errors include traceback-like messages, such as "SyntaxError: unmatched ']'" or "error: Failed to spawn: `app.py', Caused by: No such file or directory (os error 2)", and "Container was bound to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 which is why docker container port 8000 is not accessible outside (host os)", helping students diagnose issues in their code or configuration. The spreadsheet provides insights into common errors encountered by students and guidance for troubleshooting, implying a peer discussion may revolve around interpreting and resolving these logged error messages. 2x" data-dominant-color="F5F5F6">image1905×970 78.6 KB
