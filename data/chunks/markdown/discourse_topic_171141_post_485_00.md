Respected Sir,

I hope you are doing well.

This is with reference to your confirmation mail that my project 1 will be re-evaluated after end term

I would like to sincerely apologize for the oversight in my Project 1 submission. Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was named `dockerfile` (with a lowercase ‘d’) in the Github root repo instead of the required `Dockerfile` (with an uppercase ‘D’).

While the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following naming conventions precisely.

I humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future.

So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it.
