**[Discussion Image by 23f1000879]** The image shows a log file from a TDS student discussion about project discrepancies. The log indicates several errors, suggesting issues with the student's code or environment setup, captured as a peer discussion. Error messages like "B7 failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting", "Cannot read /data/b9.html" with a 404 error, and "HTTPConnectionPool...Failed to establish a new connection [Errno 111] Connection refused" point to problems with string formatting, file access, and possibly a dataset server connection failure. The task to convert a GitHub markdown file to HTML and save it to a local path seems to have succeeded, but subsequent attempts to read the converted file failed, indicating a file path or access issue. The log also shows an attempt to run a datasette via a local dataset "/data/ticket-sales.db" on port 8001, counting rows where type is Bronze, followed by issues with a connection refusal, which could be because the dataset server wasn't running or accessible at the specified port.ion: [Errno 111] Connection refused". The log also displays successful conversions of markdown files to HTML, but the overall score is 0/20, indicating significant problems in the student's implementation. This represents a debugging scenario where the student likely needs to review string formatting, file paths, and the datasette connection setup." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="eD5kqmOu4yE6aBKl8uZmG6o2EuU" width="690" height="341" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1000879]** This image depicts a student's evaluation log, likely from a project assignment in a TDS (Technical Data Science) course, showing a series of failed tasks and HTTP requests. Error messages indicate issues with string formatting, failing to read data files (like "data/b9.html" and "data/b10.csv"), and problems running a dataset via datasette, specifically related to connection refusal at port 8001. The log shows a mix of successful (HTTP 200 OK) and failed (HTTP 404 Not Found, HTTP 400 Bad Request) HTTP requests, indicating a problem with accessing and processing data for tasks like converting files and querying datasets. The student's final score is 0/20, reflecting the multiple errors encountered during the evaluation. The errors suggest problems with file paths, connection issues, and potentially incorrect syntax in the dataset queries., **[Discussion Image by 23f1000879]** This is an evaluation log showing the results of a student project, specifically post #345 in the "Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies" discussion. It indicates a series of failed tasks (B7, B8, B9, B10) alongside successful ones, as indicated by the green check mark. The failures include issues like "not all arguments converted during string formatting," inability to read generated files like `/data/b9.html` and `/data/b10.csv` (404 errors), and a "Bad Request" error when running the dataset through 'uvx datasette'. This suggests problems with file paths, string formatting in the student's code, and potential connection issues when starting the datasette server. The student's score is currently 8 out of 20 based on these results. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1000879]** This image shows an evaluation log indicating several failed tasks during a project. Specifically, tasks B7, B8, B9, and B10 are marked as failed, with associated error messages. Task B7 failed because the evaluation system could not identify the image file. Task B8 failed because not all arguments were converted during string formatting, while task B9 failed because the system could not read `/data/b9.html`, likely because the task to convert a Github file to `/data/b9.html` did not function properly. Similarly, task B10, which involved running a datasette server and saving a query result to `/data/b10.csv`, failed because a connection to the datasette server could not be established and that `/data/b10.csv` could not be read. The overall score is 8/20, suggesting significant issues in completing the project tasks. 2x" data-dominant-color="CAC9C9">image1895Ã—938 90 KB
