The evaluation checks for the presence and accessibility of the Docker image on Docker Hub, the GitHub repository, the Dockerfile in the repository's root, and the MIT license in the repository's root. The student's submission passed the first three checks, but failed the MIT license check, resulting in an overall "FAIL" status for the prerequisites and a project score of 0. The feedback indicates that failure to meet the minimum requirements will result in the submission not being evaluated. This represents a student facing an issue with the MIT license requirement of their project. image is public on Docker Hub, the GitHub repository is present and public, and a Dockerfile exists in the root of the GitHub repository; all of these components pass the checks. However, the check for the MIT license in the root of the GitHub repository failed. As a result, the overall prerequisites check failed, and the student received a project score of 0. The student will need to add an MIT license file to the root of their GitHub repository for their project to be evaluated." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="7q3y5vSuNCEbRkULMI3gUy7P9vF" width="633" height="336">image633×336 7.1 KB
