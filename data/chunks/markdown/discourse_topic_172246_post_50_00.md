Hi everyone,

A bit of data might be useful. Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights.

Firstly students *vastly* overestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS.

So of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3.

Only 2 students managed it.

Going by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6 *might* have even managed to get 3 or more marks.

*So lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination.* The mean bonus score was 1.27.

So, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally.

That is the data for you.
