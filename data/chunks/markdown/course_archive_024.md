-world insights into how these principles, along with other scaling strategies, are applied in a large-scale media streaming service. Students can learn how to design systems capable of handling extreme traffic while maintaining performance and reliability. This content is optional, suggesting it provides additional context and advanced knowledge beyond the fundamental archiving concepts.)](https://youtu.be/QjvyiyH4rr0)

# Deployment

[**[Course Image: Deployment]** When deploying archived data, the process typically involves three key steps: anonymizing the data, building an application to interact with the data, and then hosting the application. To anonymize data before archiving, tools like ARX and Amnesia, and libraries such as Faker and Mimesis can be used. Application development can leverage notebook environments like Colab or Kaggle, or create data applications using Streamlit or Shiny, or web applications using Flask or Tornado, depending on the specific requirements of the archive project. The final step involves hosting the built application so that users can access and interact with the archived data in a secure and user-friendly environment.iculum focuses on deploying the results of your data work. The process involves three key stages: anonymizing the data using tools like ARX and Amnesia, or libraries such as Faker and Mimesis; building an application using notebooks (Colab, Kaggle), data app frameworks (Streamlit, Shiny), or web app frameworks (Flask, Tornado); and finally, hosting the application to make it accessible. Anonymization is crucial for protecting sensitive information before deployment. Selecting the right app framework depends on the project's requirements and complexity.)](https://youtu.be/YSGZjCxhIkk)
