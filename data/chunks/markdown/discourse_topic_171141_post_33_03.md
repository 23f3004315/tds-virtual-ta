**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image captures a student's debugging process with error messages during a TDS project. The first section shows an HTTP POST request to a local server with a task to scrape author names from a webpage and save them to a JSON file. Following the request, the server returns an HTTP 200 OK response with the status "success", the task description, and the Python code that was generated to perform the scraping, including error handling. The next section shows an HTTP GET request to read the JSON file, which passed. Finally, the image shows the execution of another task, where downloading and resizing an image results in failures B7 and B8, with B8 specifically indicating an error related to string formatting.ing formatting logic. The information shown suggests a peer discussion where students share error outputs to collectively troubleshoot project discrepancies." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="rAPE8z6usRTHkquLBzH81ERRoZU" width="690" height="256" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image shows a student's attempt to complete project tasks, revealing both successes and failures, and is likely part of a peer discussion where students are helping each other. The initial HTTP POST request shows the task description involving web scraping author names from a website and saving them to `/data/b6.json`. The student's code snippet uses `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `json` to accomplish this; B6 passed, indicating that this part was successful. However, tasks B7 and B8 both failed, and the error message for B8 suggests a string formatting issue, while B7 involves downloading and resizing an image, which might be where the issue lies., **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image captures a student's debugging process on the TDS project, showing the output of a task execution. Task B6, involving extracting and saving authors from a webpage, passed successfully, as indicated by the green checkmark and "B6 PASSED". However, Task B7, which involves downloading and resizing an image, failed, marked by a red "X" and "B7 FAILED." Additionally, Task B8 also failed because "not all arguments converted during string formatting". The code snippet shows Python code using requests, BeautifulSoup, and json modules to scrape author names from a website, suggesting the B6 task was related to web scraping. The print statement `print (f'An error occurred: {e}')` implies a debugging process where exceptions are caught and printed to understand the cause of failure. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image captures a student's project output, showing the results of running code to scrape data and process images. Task B6, which involves scraping author names from a website and saving them to `/data/b6.json`, passed successfully. However, tasks B7 and B8 both failed; B7 involves downloading, resizing, and saving an image to `/data/b7.png` which is marked as "running" but ultimately failed and B8 failed with the error message "not all arguments converted during string formatting," indicating a problem with string formatting within the code. The screenshot shows that the student encountered errors during the image processing stage (B7/B8) after successfully completing the web scraping task (B6). 2x" data-dominant-color="F8F8F8">image2003Ã—745 95 KB
