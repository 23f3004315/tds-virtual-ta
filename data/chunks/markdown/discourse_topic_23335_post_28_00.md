As things will get structured, and the motive gets clearer to participant of this course, opinion will change, The video introduction was indeed exciting, but we as participant, who also want to score in assignment and all try to map content with ability to solve the questions and then internally rate as sufficient or insufficient, it is not about how exciting it was rather how helpful it was to score better. We don’t know how industry will judge at first, with marks, excitement, ability to learn new things and many other parameters, so when we watch video we expect it to moving around questions being asked.

It is like we `overfit ourselves to video content`, but `underfit the assignment content`. So some `regularisations`, you as a team have to add to make it just `right fit`.

Whether it’s @Anand or people like me, who themselves are teachers for more than a decade, can see the gap more profound than others and are vocal at the same time.

Trust us we are the one who reverses our opinions if things are started to get fine tuned without any hesitation or apprehension.
