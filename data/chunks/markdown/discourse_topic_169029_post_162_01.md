**[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image shows a student during the academic verification process, filling out a form to gain access or prove eligibility for a student discount or service. The form requires information such as "First name," which is already filled in with "shashikumar," "Last name," which shows a "This field is required" error, "Country" selected as "India," and "School name" with "Indian Institute Of Technology Madras (Chennai, Tamil Nadu)" already entered. A notification appears stating "Your email domain is not currently registered with us. You can choose another verification method.", indicating the initial email-based verification failed. The instructions explain the importance of providing accurate school information for verification purposes and clarifies that the school's provided email address may be used to reach the student. The student needs to fill in the "Last name" field and potentially other missing information to complete the academic verification.ar" is already entered), last name (field marked as required), country (set to "India"), school name ("Indian Institute Of Technology Madras (Chennai, Tamil Nadu)"), and date of birth. A message at the top indicates the user's email domain is not registered, suggesting alternative verification methods are needed. Additionally, a message below the country selection states that if the country is not listed, the offer is unavailable in the user's region, with a "Learn More" link. This is likely a point of potential user confusion or troubleshooting, as students may not find their institution listed, prompting a need for alternative verification or realizing the offer is not available to them." alt="tds" data-base62-sha1="e7aO41eryl39a5vyfEXRiXCoIdX" width="536" height="500" data-dominant-color="EEEFF0">tds972×906 12.2 KB
