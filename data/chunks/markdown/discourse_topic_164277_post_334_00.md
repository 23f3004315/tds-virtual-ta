## Post #334 by 21f3000512

How to handle task a8 ? I tried pytesseract but gave wrong results.EasyOCR is giving the exact answer so tried in docker but some Model download is interrupting the flow of evaluate.py resulting in error .

I appreciate any help/procedure or code to handle taska8.

Thanks in advance.
