Thanks for your reply @Saransh_Saini

I’ve figured out the solution to that particular question.

The deadline is still a concern, as many issues were only resolved during recent sessions—similar to the project 1 workflow—and This time there are many other things in the pipeline ( viva’s and oppe’s )

Anyway, I will complete this course with valuable learnings, but many others have been seriously affected by it.
