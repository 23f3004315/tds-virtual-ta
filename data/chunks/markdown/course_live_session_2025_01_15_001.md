 do?**

**A3:** GA0 is a self-assessment. If you scored above 50%, you have a good foundation. If not, consider additional learning before proceeding. The course is hands-on, and the TAs will hold sessions to help you understand the tools. The course content is available on the course introduction page, not just in the GA modules.

**Q4: The YouTube videos are not clear enough. Can we have personalized videos?**

**A4:** The TAs will hold dedicated sessions to address this learning curve. These sessions will cover the tools in detail and will be recorded and uploaded.

**Q5: I'm not from a science background and find the course difficult. What can I do?**

**A5:** The course is not an intro to programming. Focus on the practical exercises and use the TAs' sessions to get help. The instructors will consider adding more introductory sessions to address the skill gap.

**Q6: I took TDS two terms ago and haven't gained any extra skills. I only want to complete this course and leave. What should I do?**

**A6:** The course has changed significantly since two terms ago. The instructors will consider adding more support sessions to help students catch up.

**Q7: The deadline for GA1 is the 26th, and help was only provided after the deadline last term. Will this happen again?**

**A7:** The TAs will hold sessions _before_ the GA deadline to help you learn how to use the tools.

**Q8: The graded assignments (GAs) are practical, but the end-of-term exam is theory-based. Where can I learn the theory?**

**A8:** The end-of-term exam format is changing. The instructors will provide a mock exam before the actual exam. Focus on familiarizing yourself with the tools.

**Q9: I solved almost all the GA1 questions but my score is zero. Is this a glitch?**

**A9:** Your answers are likely saved. If you added a question, re-enter all answers and save again. The instructors are working on a backend fix to prevent this.

**Q10: What is the R0E and what should I focus on for grading?**

**A10:** The projects are take-home, open-internet assignments. You'll receive a dataset and questions. R0E is a remote online exam (open-internet MCQ). The instructors will provide more information on both in future sessions.

**Q11: I'm a non-IT student (Masters in Mathematics). Can I get an IT job with just the Data Science diploma?**

**A11:** It's possible, but it depends on the company's requirements. Programming skills are valuable in many fields.
