0.219: 248985". The output indicates a successful execution of the image processing steps and calculation." data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/A1I23IFTO0e9CDtcwYljSvQPQFW.png?dl=1" title="image" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">**[Discussion Image by daksh76]** This image shows a successful execution of Python code in a Google Colab environment, likely part of a student's work in the TDS Jan 2025 cohort. The code imports libraries such as numpy, PIL (Pillow), and colorsys, and then uploads an image file named "lenna.webp" using `files.upload()`. The code calculates the "lightness" of each pixel, and counts how many pixels have a lightness value greater than or equal to 0.219, printing the final count: "Number of pixels with lightness > 0.219: 248985". The successful file upload and program execution indicate that the student's code is running correctly and achieving the expected output related to image processing, demonstrating a successful image deployment.PIL (Pillow), google.colab.files, and colorsys to upload and analyze an image. It uploads the image "lenna.webp" using `files.upload()`, opens it with `Image.open()`, and calculates the lightness of each pixel using a lambda function and `colorsys.rgb_to_hls()`. Finally, it counts and prints the number of pixels with a lightness value greater than 0.219, resulting in an output of "Number of pixels with lightness > 0.219: 248985". This showcases a successful implementation of image analysis using Python and relevant libraries." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="A1I23IFTO0e9CDtcwYljSvQPQFW" width="690" height="360" data-dominant-color="303030">image857Ã—448 25.8 KB
