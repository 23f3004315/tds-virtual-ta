**[Discussion Image by 22f3000585]** This image shows a snippet of a student's (22f3000585) GitHub repository file structure, likely related to a TDS project. The student's concern stems from an apparent discrepancy surrounding the MIT license; the image displays both a "LICENSE" file with the commit message "Create LICENSE" five days prior, and an "MIT LICENSE" file, renamed from LICENSE two months prior. The file structure includes standard Python project components such as `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `test.txt`, and potentially environment related folders like `__pycache__` and `venv`, hinting at a Python-based project. The inclusion of a `Dockerfile` also indicates the project is containerized. The student's confusion, as inferred from the discussion context, likely involves understanding the correct way to implement the MIT license in their project and managing these related files in the repository.`Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `MIT LICENSE`, `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `test.txt`. Commit messages are visible, such as "Final Submission," "First Submission," "Create LICENSE," and "Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE," indicating a sequence of steps taken in creating and managing the project's license. The timestamps associated with each file show the last modification date, with some files modified "2 months ago" and the license related files updated "5 days ago," hinting at recent activity focused on license management. This structure helps contextualize potential student confusion regarding the presence and naming of the license files, particularly within the context of Project 1 requirements." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="adkBBrmRJMSeWFHmseH5sdh7mZ2" width="690" height="301" data-dominant-color="12171D">image1113Ã—487 20.2 KB
