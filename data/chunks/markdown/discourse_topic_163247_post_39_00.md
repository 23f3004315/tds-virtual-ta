## Post #39 by Divya1

**Direct Link**: [Post #39](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/163247/39)

In the 6th question ,as I open the graded assignment all the time the new question is generated (NUMERICAL DATA) and the previous answer shows as incorrect answer

My doubt is that should I again and again answer the same quetion(6) all the time until the due passes?

Is there any alternative ways to look after this problem?
