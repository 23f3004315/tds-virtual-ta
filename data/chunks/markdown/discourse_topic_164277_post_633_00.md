Thank you, sir, for giving us this amazing opportunity! Honestly, I learned more in the last week than I did throughout the three modules.

The project was a rollercoaster ride—especially with all the errors that kept popping up—but overall, the experience was incredibly enriching. The amount of knowledge I gained was truly valuable.

A huge thanks to @Carlton, @Saransh_Saini, and @Jivraj sir for their guidance and support. Without the last week’s lectures, the project couldn’t have been completed.
