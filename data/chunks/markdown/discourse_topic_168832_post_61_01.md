 tried submitting my exam at 3:14 AM EST, but my browser reloaded unexpectedly. I ended up re-entering my answers and submitted at 3:15:46 AM. I had completed eight questions (8 marks) well before the time, but got stuck on the last two.

**[Discussion Image by 22f1000535]** This screenshot, shared within a TDS student discussion titled "Remote Online Exam [TDS Jan 2025]," shows a student's exam interface, reflecting a potential concern about saved scores. The system confirms the user's login as "22f1000535@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." and presents a "Logout" button. A section labeled "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)" displays two entries: "Reload from 3/2/2025, 3:16:50 AM. Score: 8" and "Reload from 3/2/2025, 3:15:46 AM. Score: 8." The student seems concerned about getting the same score of 8 in both recent saves, raising questions about whether the system properly recorded their exam progress.2f1000535]** This image shows a screenshot from a student, identified as 22f1000535@ds.study.iitm.ac.in, logged into the online exam platform. The interface displays a "Logout" button and a "Recent saves" section, indicating that the most recent save represents the official score. The "Recent saves" section lists two saves on "3/2/2025" at "3:16:50 AM" and "3:15:46 AM", both with a score of "8", and each save has a "Reload" button associated with it. This implies the student is potentially verifying their saved scores or trying to recover a particular save state during the exam if the score is not what was expected. Therefore this image likely is asking whether the last save is actually the official score as expected and if there is a way to reload or compare the two saves., **[Discussion Image by 22f1000535]** This image from the TDS student discussion "Remote Online Exam [TDS Jan 2025]" shows a student's view of the exam interface, specifically the "Recent saves" section, indicating that the student, logged in as 22f1000535@ds.study.iitm.ac.in, can see the timestamps and scores of the last few saves made during the exam. Two saves are listed, both from 3/2/2025, with timestamps 3:16:50 AM and 3:15:46 AM, and both showing a score of 8; there are "Reload" buttons next to each entry. The UI also includes a "Logout" button. The text clarifies that the most recent save represents the official score, which suggests the student is checking to ensure their work was properly saved and scored. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f1000535]** This screenshot from a student's exam interface, specifically 22f1000535@ds.study.iitm.ac.in, shows "Recent saves" with the message "(most recent is your official score)".
