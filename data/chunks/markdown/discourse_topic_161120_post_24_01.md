**[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** The image shows a student working on the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" assignment, specifically related to filtering student data by class using an API endpoint. The student is testing the API with the URL `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class_=15`, attempting to retrieve students in class 15. The terminal output from the Python backend shows successful HTTP 200 OK responses for various API calls including OPTIONS and GET requests, with classes like "15&class=2A", "11V&class=7X", etc. The browser displays the JSON response to the initial request, showing a correctly filtered list of student IDs and their associated "15" class; however, the assignment instructions in the right-hand panel describe how to query multiple classes by chaining the class parameter (e.g. `api?class=1A&class=1B`). The instructions emphasize correct CORS configuration and provide an example API endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` and an example "Error: Response" which demonstrates a very large and unfiltered response, including all students with their corresponding classes like '10I', '12M', '5V', etc., indicating that the student may have to filter the data server-side.tch the assignment instructions describing how `class` parameters should work." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-15 at 12.12.09 AM" data-base62-sha1="wcH4DdyWhmx5z9j0Ka0Uiv4wC14" width="690" height="431" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** This image depicts a student debugging their GA2 deployment, specifically the API endpoint for filtering students by class in a FastAPI application. The student is testing the `/api?class_=15` endpoint, expecting to retrieve students in class 15 only and the terminal output shows many OPTIONS and GET requests with various class parameters, each returning a 200 OK status. The "Pretty Print" output shows the JSON response returned for `class_=15` containing student IDs 280, 298, 498, and 1501. On the right, the assignment instructions detail the API query parameter `class` and provide an example using `/api?class=1A`, also a large JSON error response demonstrates the expected format with student IDs and class labels. The student seems to be verifying the correct data retrieval based on the query parameters while potentially facing an issue with CORS or the overall correctness of the returned data format., **[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** This image captures a student working on the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" assignment, specifically the task requiring filtering students by class via an API. The student is querying the API endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?class_=1S` in a web browser and receives a JSON response with a list of students belonging to class "1S", which is displayed in a "Pretty print" format. A terminal window shows the backend logs from the Python FastAPI application, indicating successful "GET" requests to the API with various class query parameters (e.g., `api?class_=1S&class_=2A`, `api?class=11V&class=7X&class=9P&class=90`). The student seems to be testing different class combinations in the query parameters, while the browser displays the API response for a specific class. The assignment instructions emphasize CORS configuration and provide examples of query parameters. The student has achieved a score of 5.5/10 on the assignment so far. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** This image captures a student debugging a GA2 deployment assignment related to filtering students by class using a FastAPI endpoint. The student is testing the endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?class_=1S` and observes the response in the browser, which shows student IDs and classes, but the filtering is not working as expected, returning all students instead of just those in class "1S". The terminal window shows server logs of GET and OPTIONS requests to the API, including several attempts with different class parameters (`class_=1S&class_=2A`, `class=11V&class=7X&class=9P&class=90`, etc.), all returning a 200 OK status, but the browser shows that the API is not correctly filtering by classes, and the instructions on the right side of the screen details that the student needs to enable CORS and describes how the `/api?class=1A&class=1B` URL should be used for getting students in classes 1A and 1B. The student needs to review the backend logic for the API to ensure proper filtering and correct URL parameter handling, and enable CORS to avoid potential browser-related issues. 2x" data-dominant-color="2E2E2E">Screenshot 2025-01-15 at 12.12.09 AM1440Ã—900 312 KB
