**[Discussion Image by 22f3000910]** This image shows a student's question within a TDS GA4 data sourcing discussion thread, specifically asking "What is the JSON data?". A code block displays JSON data containing an array of movie objects, each with properties like "id," "title," "year," and "rating." An error message "TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'textContent')" is displayed below the JSON data, indicating a likely issue with the student's code attempting to process or render this JSON, potentially related to accessing a non-existent DOM element. The student is probably facing a JavaScript execution error while trying to extract or display 'textContent' from a null variable, likely due to an incorrect selector or timing issue. This could mean the DOM is not fully loaded when the javascript tries to access the element, or the element is misidentified in the query selector.re's a problem in how the student is attempting to display or process this JSON data in their code or tool." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-09 234028" data-base62-sha1="6aEHkbRESvgC6CYwPR5bZ8c7PlS" width="690" height="113" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f3000910]** This image captures a student's question about JSON data within the TDS Jan 2025 cohort's GA4 discussion thread, specifically related to data sourcing. The student asks, "What is the JSON data?" followed by a long string that appears to be the JSON data itself, containing movie titles, release years, ratings and unique identifiers. Below the JSON data is an error message: "TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'textContent')." This indicates a JavaScript error likely stemming from the student's code attempting to access the 'textContent' property of a null element, which likely resulted while working with the JSON data. The student is apparently encountering a problem when attempting to use or parse the JSON data, as indicated by the error., **[Discussion Image by 22f3000910]** This image shows a student asking "What is the JSON data?" and then displaying a long string of JSON-like data representing movie titles, years, and ratings. The displayed data appears to be an array of objects, with each object containing "id", "title", "year", and "rating" keys. An error message "TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'textContent')" appears below the JSON data, indicating a problem with the code attempting to process this data, specifically related to reading the 'textContent' property of a null value. This is likely a student question where they are struggling with parsing or handling the JSON data, encountering an error while doing so. The error suggests that the code is trying to access the `textContent` property of an element that doesn't exist or is null, which could stem from issues in data retrieval or manipulation within the script. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f3000910]** This image captures a student's question and a corresponding error encountered while working with JSON data in a TDS (The Data School) discussion thread, specifically "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]". The student asks, "What is the JSON data?" and includes a long string that appears to be an attempt at JSON representing movie data, including fields like "title", "year", and "rating", but it is not valid JSON. Below the JSON data, a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'textContent')` error message is displayed, indicating a problem with the student's code attempting to access the text content of a null element. This suggests a coding issue where the student is trying to manipulate the text content of an element that either doesn't exist or hasn't been properly initialized. 2x" data-dominant-color="323539">Screenshot 2025-02-09 2340281910Ã—314 56.7 KB
