**[Discussion Image by 23f3002537]** This image shows a student attempting a coding challenge and encountering an error related to data sourcing in GA4. The student is prompted to identify the JSON weather forecast for Nur-Sultan. They provide a JSON object containing forecast descriptions for various dates in February 2025, but receive an error "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')". The provided JSON appears syntactically correct, suggesting the error might stem from how the system is processing or expecting the input, or a possible issue in the evaluation logic server-side, rather than directly from the provided JSON data itself. The student can click the "Check" button to submit their answer, but the error message suggests the submission will likely fail, indicating the need for debugging. provides a JSON-like structure with dates and corresponding weather conditions. However, the response is flagged with a red error icon, and below the answer box, a "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')" is displayed, indicating that the entered JSON format or data is causing an issue within the grading system. The student is likely confused about the correct JSON format expected or there is an unexpected error in the automated grading." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="yRjGun84ROwG7EQkDvJ2lxPl7cx" width="688" height="500" data-dominant-color="25292F">image835Ã—606 34.6 KB
