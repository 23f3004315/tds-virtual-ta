 the results be released. And also in the image I attached it I think shows five different scores for each questions you asked through curl. Is that the mark for each questions and total mark should be considered?

also want to know if we need to do any extra projects for the bonus marks.

thank you

**[Discussion Image by HARISH.S]** This image shows the terminal output from the TDS solver application while processing several questions. The output shows the application's information logs, including the data science tool being used (e.g., GA2/third.py), the question being processed (e.g., "LexiSolve Inc. is a startup..."), the score associated with the question, and the POST request made to the server along with a 200 OK response indicating a successful HTTP request. The file path where the question file is located is also displayed, along with the question itself. This is likely a peer or student sharing successful runs of the TDS solver on different questions from the project.uestion processing." alt="1000083109" data-base62-sha1="2owrtaveka6CdUX9frFhwj5ZpFf" width="663" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by HARISH.S]** The image shows a console output from the TDS solver application, indicating the processing of various questions from different files. It logs the processing of questions from files like "third.py", "second.py", "eighteenth.py", "sixth.py", and "seventh.py", specifying the file path and associated score for each. Each question processed also shows the INFO log, including the full question text, and a "POST /ask HTTP/1.1" 200 OK message confirming successful HTTP requests, presumably to a question-answering API. The user's GitHub username is anonymized in the query URL. The file used in the query points to a local path related to the "codeium-language-server.json", which likely provides code completion and other language-related features for the IDE. This is a technical output showing the internal workings of the TDS solver application during question processing., **[Discussion Image by HARISH.S]** This image shows the terminal output from a TDS (Textual Data Science) application, indicating a peer discussion where a student is likely running the TDS solver. The output displays a series of processed questions, each associated with a file path (e.g., `E://data science tool//GA2//third.py`), a score, and the actual question being processed (e.g., "LexiSolve Inc. is a startup that delivers a conv"). The terminal shows "POST /ask HTTP/1.1" 200 OK", suggesting successful HTTP requests. This likely represents the student attempting to run and test the TDS solver on different questions and files, probably as part of Project 2, to verify its functionality and performance. The output also indicates the processing of questions related to startups, SQLite databases, Hacker News RSS API usage, and data analysis roles. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by HARISH.S]** This image shows the terminal output of a student running the TDS solver for "Project 2". The output displays the processing of several questions, including the file being used (e.g., `third.py`, `second.py`, `eighteenth.py`, `sixth.py`, `seventh.py`), their corresponding scores, and the question text itself. The output also shows the HTTP POST requests to the server (e.g., `POST /ask HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`). The student appears to be testing the solver with different questions and Python files. The screenshot provides insight into the iterative testing and debugging process. 2x" data-dominant-color="5C5455">10000831091920Ã—1446 286 KB
