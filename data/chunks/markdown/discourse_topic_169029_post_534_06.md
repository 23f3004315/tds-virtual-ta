**[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image captures a peer discussion on the TDS project, specifically focusing on debugging the Swagger UI implementation within Postman. The Postman UI is configured to send a POST request to "http://localhost:8000/api" and includes a URL pointing to the Azure-deployed application. The "Body" tab is selected, and the "HTML" view shows the HTML code for embedding Swagger UI, including a script tag referencing the Swagger UI bundle from a CDN and javascript code to instantiate the `SwaggerUIBundle` with configuration options like `url: '/openapi.json'`, `dom_id: '#swagger-ui'`, and `layout: "BaseLayout"`. The status code is 200 OK, indicating a successful HTTP request, but the issue likely lies in properly rendering the Swagger UI within the HTML body. This configuration suggests a troubleshooting attempt to manually render Swagger UI elements, hinting at a problem or misunderstanding in the automated integration or deployment process.e student is likely attempting to use Swagger UI to test their API endpoints. The student appears to be in the Body section and has selected to view the raw HTML response, which displays the Swagger UI setup." alt="post" data-base62-sha1="osCebqbvGLvJqudqvYFnlkFOjVU" width="690" height="457" srcset="**[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image shows a student's attempt to access the Swagger UI for their TDS project, captured from Postman. The student is using a POST request, although Swagger UI typically uses GET requests. The URL being accessed is `http://localhost:8000/api` and `shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs`. The response Body (HTML) includes JavaScript code configuring Swagger UI, specifying the URL for the OpenAPI specification (`/openapi.json`), the DOM ID (`#swagger-ui`), and the layout (`BaseLayout`). The status code "200 OK" indicates the server responded successfully with this HTML content. The student may be trying to debug why the Swagger UI is not rendering correctly, and this HTML response shows the Swagger UI initialization code., **[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image shows a student using Postman to interact with an API, specifically to view the Swagger UI documentation. The URL being accessed is http://localhost:8000/api and shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs. The Postman interface is configured with a POST request, and the user is viewing the response body in HTML format, which contains HTML and JavaScript code to initialize Swagger UI. The HTML includes a div with the id "swagger-ui" and a script tag loading the Swagger UI bundle from a CDN, setting the URL to '/openapi.json', the dom_id to '#swagger-ui', and the layout to "BaseLayout". At the bottom, the status indicates a successful 200 OK response. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image depicts a student's view of the Postman application, likely showcasing a troubleshooting step within the context of the TDS solver project. The student has entered `http://localhost:8000/api` and `shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs` as the endpoint URLs in the Postman address bar, and has sent a POST request. The "Body" section shows HTML code including a div with id "swagger-ui" and a script tag loading the Swagger UI bundle from a CDN, indicating an attempt to display Swagger documentation. The Postman response shows a 200 OK status, which means the request was successful, and the Swagger UI files were served correctly. Therefore, the focus is on rendering the Swagger UI within the response body. 2x" data-dominant-color="212222">post1535Ã—1018 36.8 KB
