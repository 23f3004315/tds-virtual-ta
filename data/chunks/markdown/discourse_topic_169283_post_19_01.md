**[Discussion Image by 23f3001601]** This image shows a question from "Graded assignment 6" asking students to analyze factors influencing motorcycle resale value using Pearson Correlation Coefficient. The question presents the scenario of a strategic consultant for a premium motorcycle dealership evaluating the impact of mileage (km/l), average daily distance traveled, and engine capacity on price retention for Honda motorcycles in Maharashtra. The problem asks to determine the correlation coefficient and its respective factor. The image also displays multiple-choice answers, with the student having selected "Mileage: -0.04" as their answer. This represents a point in a student's individual work, and does not display back-and-forth discussion with peers or instructors.g a student's response during the completion of the assessment. The image does not contain any error messages, code snippets, or navigation steps, focusing solely on the content of the question." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="lrXmd4rKqCvHw9vxjDwssxhuPML" width="690" height="197" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f3001601]** This image depicts a question from "Graded assignment 6" related to a TDS course, showing a multiple-choice question on factors influencing motorcycle resale value. The question asks the student to analyze the impact of mileage, average daily distance traveled, and engine capacity on price retention for Honda motorcycles in Maharashtra, using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. The available options are correlation values for AvgDistance, EngineCapacity, and Mileage. The student has selected the option 'Mileage: -0.04'. This is part of a graded assignment, indicating a student's attempt to answer the question., **[Discussion Image by 23f3001601]** This image shows a multiple-choice question from a graded assignment. The question asks the student to analyze the impact of mileage, average daily distance, and engine capacity on Honda motorcycle resale value in Maharashtra, using Pearson Correlation Coefficient and price retention (resale price / original price). The student has selected 'Mileage: -0.04' as the answer from the options: 'AvgDistance: -0.04', 'AvgDistance: 0.95', 'EngineCapacity: -0.04', and 'Mileage: -0.04'. This is likely a student attempt to answer a quiz question within the TDS course. The answer choices presented suggest the question is focused on interpreting correlation coefficients between variables. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f3001601]** This image shows a multiple-choice question from a graded assignment focused on analyzing factors influencing motorcycle resale value. The question asks students to use the Pearson Correlation Coefficient to evaluate the impact of mileage (km/l), average daily distance traveled, and engine capacity on price retention (%) for Honda motorcycles in Maharashtra. The formula for price retention is provided as (resale price / original price). The student has selected the answer 'Mileage: -0.04' from the available options: 'AvgDistance: -0.04', 'AvgDistance: 0.95', 'EngineCapacity: -0.04', and 'Mileage: -0.04'. This is a closed-ended question likely intended to test comprehension and application of correlation analysis principles. 2x" data-dominant-color="F7F7F7">image1318Ã—377 34.2 KB
