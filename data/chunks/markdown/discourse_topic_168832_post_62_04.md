**[Discussion Image by 23f2000599]** This image shows a student attempting a question on a remote online exam within the TDS discussion forum. The student's question asks: "What is the total Biology marks of students who scored 30 or more marks in Maths in groups 1-28 (including both groups)?". The student has entered "34919" as their answer, but the system has returned an error message "Incorrect. Try again." indicating that the submitted answer is wrong. This suggests the student is seeking assistance or verification of their approach from peers or instructors within the discussion thread. The interface displays a text input box with a red border and an alert symbol to indicate incorrect input.groups 1-28 (including both groups)?". The student entered "34919" in a text input field, but the system responded with the message "Incorrect. Try again." accompanied by an error icon inside the text entry box, indicating a wrong answer. This suggests the student is having trouble calculating the correct sum of Biology marks based on the given criteria related to Maths scores across multiple groups. The image captures the interactive, real-time feedback a student receives during an online exam and highlights a possible point of difficulty in understanding or processing the data to arrive at the correct answer." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="46CuuEZv4QNr9XwBxn7mginw5h2" width="690" height="170" data-dominant-color="FAF8F9">image905Ã—223 10.1 KB
