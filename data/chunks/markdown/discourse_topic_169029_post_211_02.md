The student is likely providing this information as part of setting up their project environment or verifying their participation in the TDS course. This image could be part of a larger discussion where students are ensuring their correct email addresses are associated with their accounts or project submissions.udy.iitm.ac.in". This appears to be a student providing their school email address, likely for project submission or identification purposes within the TDS solver environment. It may represent the first step in troubleshooting or clarifying an issue, where providing the correct email could be key. The image does not show any error messages, code snippets, or specific troubleshooting steps, but sets the context for a discussion related to the project." alt="Screenshot 2025-03-31 064552" data-base62-sha1="ddVKSeHmBQXrXMG4leCdkwV0ebt" width="690" height="89" data-dominant-color="F4F5F5">Screenshot 2025-03-31 064552913×119 3.63 KB
