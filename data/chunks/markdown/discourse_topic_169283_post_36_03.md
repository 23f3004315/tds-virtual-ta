**[Discussion Image by Muthupalaniappan]** This image depicts a correlation matrix, likely generated as part of the "Graded assignment 6" student discussion on TDS. The matrix shows the pairwise correlations between "Mileage (km/l)", "Avg Daily Distance (km)", "Engine Capacity (cc)", and "Price Retention (%)". The matrix uses a color scheme ranging from blue to red, indicating negative to positive correlations respectively, with numerical values displayed in each cell. For instance, the correlation between "Mileage (km/l)" and "Engine Capacity (cc)" is shown as 0.01, suggesting a very weak positive correlation. The diagonal elements are 1.00, indicating a perfect correlation of a variable with itself. are all 1.00, as expected, representing the correlation of each variable with itself. The color scheme, from blue to red, visually represents the strength and direction of the correlation, with blue indicating a negative correlation and red indicating a positive correlation." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="s80SERWXLf5h1F6b2sPPUE8anfK" width="690" height="397" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Muthupalaniappan]** This image depicts a correlation matrix, likely generated as part of a data analysis assignment, showing the relationships between different car features. The matrix visualizes the correlation coefficients between 'Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)', and 'Price Retention (%)'. The diagonal values are 1.00, indicating perfect correlation of a feature with itself, while off-diagonal values represent correlations between different pairs of features. For example, the correlation between 'Engine Capacity (cc)' and 'Mileage (km/l)' is shown as 0.01, and between 'Engine Capacity (cc)' and 'Avg Daily Distance (km)' is 0.04, with 'Price Retention (%)' and 'Avg Daily Distance (km)' at -0.13. The colorbar on the right likely maps color intensity to the magnitude of the correlation coefficient, with red representing positive and blue negative correlation., **[Discussion Image by Muthupalaniappan]** This image shows a correlation heatmap generated within a student discussion, likely related to a graded assignment involving data analysis. The heatmap visualizes the correlation coefficients between four variables: Mileage (km/l), Avg Daily Distance (km), Engine Capacity (cc), and Price Retention (%). The values within the heatmap range from -0.13 to 1.00, with 1.00 indicating perfect positive correlation between a variable and itself (along the diagonal). The color scheme uses a blue-white-red scale, where blue indicates negative correlations, white indicates near-zero correlations, and red indicates positive correlations. Notably, "Engine Capacity (cc)" and "Price Retention (%)" show a relatively weak correlation (0.09), while "Avg Daily Distance (km)" has a slight negative correlation (-0.13) with "Price Retention (%)". 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Muthupalaniappan]** This image is a student post showing the correlation matrix plot of car features from TDS Assignment 6. The matrix visualizes the correlation coefficients between 'Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)', and 'Price Retention (%)'. Values range from -1 to 1, represented by a color gradient where blue indicates negative correlation and red indicates positive correlation. Specific correlation values are displayed within each cell, for example, the correlation between 'Engine Capacity (cc)' and 'Mileage (km/l)' is 0.01 and between 'Price Retention (%)' and 'Avg Daily Distance (km)' is -0.13. The diagonal entries which show the correlation of each feature with itself are 1.00 (perfect positive correlation), visualized as red. 2x" data-dominant-color="C3BBE0">image748Ã—431 17.5 KB
