## Post #26 by Anand

Well, here’s an admission…I stand corrected on my opinion about the TDS course.

with each day watching and learning from the course, I’m absolutely excited to see the content! It’s presented so well, so well, that I can vouch that I’ve never seen anything like this before…

I was totally wrong and wanted to let everyone here know how perspectives can change in a matter of just 2 weeks.

Having said all this, I still believe the first video in this course was misplaced, and that was perhaps a very bad decision by the editors…not the course team. If my blunt comments hurt anyone, which I’m sure it did, I apologize @maheshbalan
