## Regression with Excel

[**[Course Image: Regression with Excel]** This image illustrates the output of a regression analysis performed in Excel, specifically showing the ANOVA table and regression statistics. The ANOVA table displays the degrees of freedom (df), sum of squares (SS), mean square (MS), F-statistic, and significance F for the regression and residual components, which helps assess the overall fit of the model. The regression statistics section provides coefficient estimates, standard errors, t-stats, p-values, and confidence intervals for each independent variable (e.g., 'new_cases', 'new_tests', 'new_vacc', 'stringency') and the intercept. P-values help determine the statistical significance of each variable's impact on the dependent variable and confidence intervals allow us to see the reasonable range of values for each coefficient. These outputs are critical for interpreting the results of a regression model, understanding the significance and direction of the relationships between variables, and assessing the model's overall predictive power, so remember to check these when building your own models!the regression output in Excel, specifically focusing on how to interpret the ANOVA and coefficient tables generated after performing a regression analysis. The ANOVA table shows the degrees of freedom (df), sum of squares (SS), mean square (MS), F statistic, and significance F value, which helps assess the overall significance of the regression model. The coefficient table presents the coefficients, standard errors, t-statistics, p-values, and confidence intervals for each independent variable (like new cases, new tests, new vaccinations, and stringency), along with the intercept. By examining the p-values, you can determine which independent variables have a statistically significant impact on the dependent variable. This helps in understanding the relationship between the predictors and the outcome in a regression model built within Excel.)](https://youtu.be/AERQBMIHwXA)
