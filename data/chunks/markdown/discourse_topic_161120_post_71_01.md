**[Discussion Image by 23f2004169]** This image shows an error screen from ngrok, indicating a problem with establishing a connection to the upstream web service. The error "ERR_NGROK_8012" states that traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, but the agent couldn't connect to the web service at "undefined://localhost:52525," resulting in a "dial tcp [::1]:52525: connect: connection refused" error. The troubleshooting steps suggest ensuring a web service is running on "undefined://localhost:52525" where the ngrok agent is running and to try cURL or opening the address in a browser to get the correct response, or refresh the page and if that doesn't work to contact the developer. This appears to be a student facing an issue where their ngrok tunnel is not connecting to their local application because the application is not running or is running on a different port/address. The root cause seems to be a configuration issue where the host is "undefined" which will prevent ngrok from correctly tunneling.advice suggests ensuring a web service is running on `undefined://localhost:52525`, trying `curl` or opening the address in a browser to check the response, which likely helps students resolve connectivity issues with ngrok during deployment by confirming if the local service is accessible." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="t7DdWVFDAOBLK7U9rjFwiAH8unz" width="690" height="401" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2004169]** This image depicts a troubleshooting scenario in a TDS student discussion related to GA2 - Deployment Tools, specifically using ngrok. The error, "ERR_NGROK_8012," indicates that while traffic successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, the agent failed to connect to the upstream web service at `undefined://localhost:52525`. The detailed error message "dial tcp [::1]:52525: connect: connection refused" suggests that the web service isn't running or accessible on the specified port. The error screen suggests the user, as the developer, should ensure a web service is running on `undefined://localhost:52525` and recommends testing the connection using cURL or a browser. This screenshot represents a student encountering a common issue during deployment, likely due to an improperly configured or non-running local server., **[Discussion Image by 23f2004169]** This image depicts an error screen from ngrok, indicating an issue where the ngrok agent could not establish a connection to the upstream web service. The error message "ERR_NGROK_8012" states that traffic was tunneled, but the connection to `undefined://localhost:52525` failed, with the specific error being "dial tcp [::1]:52525: connect: connection refused". The screen suggests that the developer should ensure a web service is running on the specified localhost port, and recommends trying `cURL` or opening the address in a browser for testing. This error points towards a backend service not running or accessible at the expected address and port, which could be a source of student confusion when deploying applications. The ngrok UI indicates the error is occurring at the "Your Service" stage, after successfully passing through the internet, ngrok edge, and ngrok agent steps. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2004169]** This image depicts an error encountered by a student during the deployment process, specifically using ngrok. The error message "ERR_NGROK_8012" indicates that while traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, the agent failed to establish a connection to the upstream web service, which it attempts to connect to at "undefined://localhost:52525". The specific error encountered was "dial tcp [::1]:52525: connect: connection refused," meaning ngrok couldn't connect to the specified localhost address and port. Ngrok suggests ensuring a web service is running at "undefined://localhost:52525" on the machine running the ngrok agent, possibly indicating a misconfiguration where "undefined" should be replaced with "http" or "https." The student likely needs to verify that their application is running correctly on port 52525 and that the ngrok tunnel is configured to point to the correct protocol (http/https) and address. 2x" data-dominant-color="EBEBEF">image1566Ã—912 46.1 KB
