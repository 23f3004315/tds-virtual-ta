**[Discussion Image by bhavanagv]** This image depicts a UI interface, likely used for API testing or documentation, displaying the response to a POST request made to the URL "https://bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api." The request includes headers such as 'accept: application/json' and 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' and a 'question' parameter that requests the development of a system using API integration and data retrieval, specifically using the BBC weather API. The server response indicates a "200" status code and shows a JSON formatted response body containing weather data for various dates in the year 2025. The dates are incorrect, showing "2005-04-15" instead of "2025-04-15", and it is implied that the student is troubleshooting an issue related to incorrect date formatting in the output or API request parameters. The interface provides options to "Execute" the request, "Clear" the display, and "Download" the response.ON response body containing weather forecasts for various dates in April 2025 (with typographical errors suggesting 2021 was intended), indicating the API is functioning correctly. The student's task is to develop a system that automates API integration and data retrieval using the BBC Weather API." alt="Screenshot 2025-04-15 153318" data-base62-sha1="hbPBdW07Avu0DDa1mIYNzAInFDy" width="690" height="347" srcset="**[Discussion Image by bhavanagv]** This image shows a student interaction with an API testing interface likely used for Project 2 (TDS Solver). The interface displays a cURL command for a POST request to `https://bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`, including headers for content type and accepting JSON, and a "question" parameter likely containing the task description: "API Integration and Data Retrieval: Use the BBC Weather API to fetch the weather...". The response from the server is a 200 OK status code, with a JSON response body that contains a dictionary mapping dates in the format "2025-04-xx" (appears to be a typo, supposed to be 2005, or 2021 given context) to weather descriptions such as "Sunny and light winds" or "Thundery showers and a gentle breeze". The student seems to be successfully retrieving data from their API endpoint. A "Download" button is visible to allow downloading the response., **[Discussion Image by bhavanagv]** This image shows a student's successful API call within the TDS Solver project, specifically in the "Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread". The student executed a POST request to the endpoint `https://bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api` with the content type `multipart/form-data` and a question formulated as a task involving API integration and data retrieval using the BBC Weather API. The server response indicates a successful request (code 200), with the response body containing a JSON structure with a key "answer," which holds weather forecasts for specific dates ranging from "2025-04-15" to "2025-04-28." The forecast includes conditions like "Sunny and light winds," "Thundery showers and light winds," and "Thundery showers a gentle breeze." The image captures a successful implementation of the API call and displays the returned weather data. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by bhavanagv]** This image shows a successful API call made as part of a student project, likely for a TDS solver. The student is using a POST request to the URL `https://bhavanaproj2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api` with a `multipart/form-data` content type, including a 'question' parameter containing the task description: API Integration and Data Retrieval using the BBC Weather API. The server responds with a 200 OK status code and a JSON response body. The response contains an "answer" dictionary, where each date (from 2025-04-15 to 2025-04-28) is mapped to a weather forecast, such as "Sunny and light winds" or "Thundery showers and a gentle breeze." The UI also displays the curl command that can be used to reproduce the API call. 2x" data-dominant-color="99A09E">Screenshot 2025-04-15 1533181914Ã—964 75.2 KB
