You will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form.

I will also add the same in the student seek portal.

Mock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either!

The gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team.

Kind regards
