**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image depicts a student, likely named Abhay227, encountering a 404 error on Docker Hub while trying to access the tags for the `version1` repository. The URL `https://hub.docker.com/r/abhay227/version1/tags` is visible in the browser address bar, indicating the specific resource that could not be found. The error message states "404 - Oops! The page you have requested was not found." This suggests that either the repository or tag doesn't exist, or there might be a typo in the URL being used by the student.

The student, presumably 'abhay227', is attempting to view the tags for the 'version1' image in their repository based on the URL `https://hub.docker.com/r/abhay227/version1/tags`. The error message "404: Oops! The page you have requested was not found" suggests that either the repository, image, or specific tag does not exist or is not publicly accessible under that URL. This is likely part of a TDS student discussion about troubleshooting Docker-related issues, possibly regarding their first project where they are expected to push images to Docker Hub. The student might be confused about the correct naming conventions or access permissions required to view their Docker Hub repository., **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image depicts a student encountering a "404 Not Found" error while trying to access a specific page on Docker Hub, specifically the tags associated with the repository "abhay227/version1", indicating a potential issue with the repository's existence, accessibility, or the correctness of the URL. The error message "Oops! The page you have requested was not found" confirms that the requested resource could not be located on the server. This suggests the student may have mistyped the URL, the repository or tag may not exist, or there could be a permission issue preventing access. This scenario represents a typical troubleshooting situation where a student needs to verify the repository name, its existence, and their Docker Hub account permissions to resolve the error. The student may also need to check if the repository is private or public, as this can affect accessibility. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image depicts a student's question regarding a 404 error encountered on Docker Hub. The screenshot shows the Docker Hub website displaying a "404 - Oops! The page you have requested was not found" error. The URL in the address bar reads "https://hub.docker.com/r/abhay227/version1/tags", suggesting the student was attempting to access the tags for a Docker image named "version1" under the user "abhay227". This indicates the student may be following instructions or attempting to pull a specific image tag as part of an assignment, and is facing issues with finding the specified resource on Docker Hub. The student's confusion likely stems from either a typo in the URL, the image or tag not existing, or a potential permissions issue if the repository is private. 2x" data-dominant-color="154060">image1902Ã—943 93.3 KB
