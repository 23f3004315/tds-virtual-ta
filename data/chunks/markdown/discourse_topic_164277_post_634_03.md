**[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image depicts a user's Codespaces resource usage, showing the consumption of included quotas in the TDS Project 1 discussion thread. It appears the student has used all 180 included core hours as indicated by "180.00 of 180.00 included core hours used," represented by a red bar. They've also used 9.60 of 20.00 included GB-month of storage, shown with a blue bar, and the displayed cost for both is $0.00. The interface also informs the user that "Included quotas reset in 8 days" and links to billing documentation, suggesting this is potentially part of troubleshooting resource usage or understanding billing implications. Future students might use this image to gauge their own Codespaces usage and anticipate potential billing issues related to exceeding quota limits. usage or manage resource allocation more effectively for the LLM-based Automation Agent project, which may include asking about strategies to reduce computational load or use resources more efficiently within the given quota. This is a visual representation of the student's resource consumption within their Codespaces environment." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-17 200525" data-base62-sha1="rlmwKGVLoqyj7lVVSeCMUJGzMiX" width="690" height="168" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** The image shows the Codespaces usage dashboard for a student in the TDS Project 1 discussion, indicating that they have used 180.00 out of 180.00 included core hours, marked with a red bar, and 9.60 out of 20.00 included GB-month for storage, marked with a blue bar; both currently show a $0.00 charge. The student likely posted this image to express concern about exceeding usage limits or to confirm how usage is being tracked in Codespaces for the project. The dashboard indicates that included quotas will reset in 8 days and links to billing documentation for further details. This is likely part of a discussion about managing resources efficiently during the project to avoid unexpected costs., **[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** The image depicts a student's Codespaces usage dashboard, showing resource consumption for the LLM-based automation agent project, indicating that the included quotas will reset in 8 days. The "Usage hours" section displays "180.00 of 180.00 included core hours used", represented by a fully consumed red bar, suggesting the student has exhausted their allocated compute time for Codespaces. The "Storage" section shows "9.60 of 20.00 included GB-month used", accompanied by a partially filled blue bar, indicating that almost half of the storage quota has been consumed. The right side shows that both usage sections are at $0.00 so far, likely because the free tier is used. This suggests the student may be seeking guidance on how to manage resource consumption within Codespaces for the project. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image shows a Codespaces usage report in response to a student's question in the TDS discussion thread about exceeding usage limits for Project 1. The report indicates that the student has used 180.00 of 180.00 included core hours, represented by a red bar, and 9.60 of 20.00 included GB-month of storage, depicted with a blue bar. The quotas will reset in 8 days, and a link to "billing documentation" is provided for more details. Both the usage hours and storage are currently at $0.00 charge. This clarifies the student's concern about potential charges or limitations due to exceeding the included core hour limit in Codespaces, demonstrating a real-time report of resource consumption. 2x" data-dominant-color="171A21">Screenshot 2025-02-17 2005251312×321 18.5 KB
