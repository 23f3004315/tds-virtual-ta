## Post #70 by 21f2000709

**Direct Link**: [Post #70](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/169029/70)

So I was thinking to create the project 2 together and I was looking for collaboration, and for that we would require the following:

→ the set of question-answers pairs at first

→ All the questions of 2 distinct students to see which parameters changes in each questions

→ Make the solution functional and parameterised based on previous step.

Till now I have created the following:

→ Identification of the question, using embeddings

→ extraction of parameters using llm for that particular question

→ Implementation of 3 questions using this approach

If we come together, we all can reduce the workload and complete it on time.

*Those who resonate with my approach or have any different approach feel free to leave a DM. I might not respond immediately as I might not be online all the time
