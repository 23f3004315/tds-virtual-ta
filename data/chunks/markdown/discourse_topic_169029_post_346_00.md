Dear Sir @carlton,

Sir, please note that after the deadline I haven’t resubmitted the form but I have edited it (as the form was allowing editing till then). Now what exactly have I edited is just added a “/” at the end and that’s it and nothing more. Highlighting it again, I haven’t resubmitted the form but edited it on the very next morning after the deadline.

So now my question is: My edited response will be accepted right in this case?

Sir, please throw some light on my doubt.

Warm Regards,

Tensed TDS Student
