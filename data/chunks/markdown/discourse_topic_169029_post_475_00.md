Dear Sirs,

Most of us have hosted our projects in Azure and this is costing us real money .. We have just gotten to a stage where if you could just please let us know if our endpoints have been evaluated and there is some score we will happily take it down.

Kindly bear in mind the there is a financial component ( some of us have free accounts ) involved here and I urge and request you to kindly expedite the evaluation process so that we decrease the financial burden placed upon us by this exerciseâ€¦
