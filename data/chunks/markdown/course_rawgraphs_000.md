## RAWgraphs

[**[Course Image: RAWGraphs 1.0 - Introduction (1 min)]** RAWgraphs is a data visualization tool that provides a wide array of chart types to represent data effectively; to start, the tool presents a "Choose a Chart" interface with various options. One of the highlighted chart options is the "Scatter Plot," ideal for displaying the relationship between two variables using Cartesian coordinates. Other available chart types include Convex Hull, Delaunay Triangulation, Hexagonal Binning, Voronoi Tessellation, Box Plot, Circular Dendrogram, Cluster Dendrogram, Circle Packing, Clustered Force Layout, Sunburst, Treemap, Alluvial Diagram, Parallel Coordinates, Bar Chart, Pie Chart, Gantt Chart, Area Graph, Bump Chart, and Horizon Graph. This selection allows users to choose the most appropriate visualization based on the nature and complexity of their dataset and the insights they wish to communicate.ep is to choose a chart type from the available options. The interface presents a variety of charts, including Scatter Plot, Convex Hull, Delaunay Triangulation, Hexagonal Binning, Voronoi Tessellation, Box Plot, Circle Packing, Clustered Force Layout, Sunburst, Treemap, Alluvial Diagram, Parallel Coordinates, Bar Chart, Pie Chart, Gantt Chart, Bump Chart, and Horizon Graph. Each chart type is displayed with a thumbnail preview and a brief description. For example, the Scatter Plot is described as a type of mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for two variables, and is highlighted with a green checkmark as the currently selected chart.)](https://youtu.be/2TtYlty-M5g)
