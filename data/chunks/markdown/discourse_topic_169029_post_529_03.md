**[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image captures a student's terminal output while debugging a FastAPI application for the TDS project. The student, Gaurav, uses a `curl` command to send a POST request to the `/api/` endpoint, providing a question about the number of Wednesdays within a specified date range via multipart form data. The application responds with an `answer` value of "1121," indicating the number of Wednesdays found, which is shown in the terminal output after the curl command's execution. The code snippet shows the FastAPI setup, including CORS middleware, and the `/api/` endpoint implemented with `async def process_question`. This appears to be a peer or self-debugging moment where the student is verifying the API's response to a specific question.question with parameters for both text and file inputs." alt="Screenshot 2025-04-15 at 7.01.06 PM" data-base62-sha1="gTtmhi0LxHN3dP1z8z9zLX4jLPW" width="690" height="400" srcset="**[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image shows a student's terminal output after making a POST request to their FastAPI application. The student, Gaurav, used a `curl` command to send a question: "How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-08-06 to 2008-01-29?" to the "/api/" endpoint. The application's response, visible in the terminal, is `{"answer":"1121"}`. The code editor shows the `main.py` file in the `app` directory, which includes imports from `fastapi`, CORS middleware setup, and the `/api/` endpoint function `process_question`. It uses `FastAPI`, `File`, `UploadFile`, `Form`, and defines CORS settings to allow origins, credentials, methods, and headers., **[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image captures a student's successful execution of a `curl` command to interact with their FastAPI application for the "TDS Solver" project, which is visible in the VS Code editor in the background. The main.py file open in the editor shows the FastAPI setup, including CORS middleware configuration and the "/api/" endpoint definition for processing questions via a POST request. The terminal output demonstrates the student, gauravghodge, using `curl` to send a question ("How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-08-06 to 2008-01-297") to the `/api/` endpoint and receiving a JSON response containing the answer "1121". The successful execution indicates the API is working correctly and able to process questions. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image shows a student, Gaurav, testing their TDS solver project. The project directory, "TDS-PROJECT-2.2," is open in VS Code. The "main.py" file is displayed in the editor, showing FastAPI setup, CORS middleware addition, and a "/api/" endpoint for processing questions using `app.post`. In the terminal, Gaurav executes a `curl` command, sending a POST request to "http://localhost:8000/api/" with a multipart form containing the question: "How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-08-06 to 2008-01-29?". The API responds with the JSON payload `{"answer":"1121"}`, which suggests a successful API request and a calculated answer. This represents a peer discussion demonstrating functional usage of the TDS solver. 2x" data-dominant-color="242628">Screenshot 2025-04-15 at 7.01.06 PM1920Ã—1115 106 KB
