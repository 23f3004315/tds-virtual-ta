EDIT: Update on previous post.

Attached image of requests made on my endpoint by I presume the TDS team at 4:53 PM on 10th April:

**[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image shows a student's terminal output, which is part of a discussion about the TDS Solver project. The terminal displays ngrok's output, indicating the student is using ngrok to expose their local server. The output shows a series of "POST /api" requests, with a mix of "200 OK" and "307 Temporary Redirect" status codes, suggesting the student may be encountering some redirection issues in their API calls. The student is likely seeking help understanding or resolving the "307 Temporary Redirect" responses. This falls under peer discussion about TDS solver, where students are likely sharing their challenges and solutions.uests are correctly handled. The screenshot indicates that the student is using ngrok to expose their local server to a public URL for testing purposes." alt="IMG-20250410-WA0033" data-base62-sha1="qp1XONLLW19xsSUqle4mkWmrdnY" width="281" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image shows the output from `ngrok` running in the terminal, displaying a log of HTTP requests made to the exposed application. The log entries show a mix of "307 Temporary Redirect" and "200 OK" status codes for POST requests to the `/api/` endpoint. The user is likely investigating why some requests result in temporary redirects while others succeed directly. The user also included the ngrok status, including the local address, ngrok URL, and performance metrics like request timings. The presence of both 307 redirects and 200 OK responses indicates potential configuration or routing issue on the server side that the student is trying to understand within the TDS Solver project., **[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image shows the terminal output related to ngrok and API requests, likely a student troubleshooting their TDS solver project. The screen displays ngrok status, including the forwarding URL (https://c7f6-150-107-43-5.ngrok-free.app) and local address (http://127.0.0.1:4040). Below this are logs of POST requests to "/api/", alternating between "307 Temporary Redirect" and "200 OK" status codes. These codes suggest the student might be experiencing issues with redirects or potentially incorrect URL configurations, which could be a point of confusion regarding the API calls and their resolution. The repetition of the redirect followed by OK suggests a loop or repeated attempt to reach the final endpoint. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image captures a student question regarding the TDS solver project, specifically showing console output with HTTP status codes. The console output displays multiple "POST /api/" requests, some resulting in "307 Temporary Redirect" and others in "200 OK". The student is likely seeking clarification on why some requests are being redirected, and what might be causing the difference in status codes. The ngrok URL is visible, suggesting the student is using ngrok to expose their local server. The status codes are interleaved, suggesting the problem might not be consistently happening, and the student may be confused by the mixed responses from the API. 2x" data-dominant-color="54422E">IMG-20250410-WA00331920Ã—3413 316 KB
