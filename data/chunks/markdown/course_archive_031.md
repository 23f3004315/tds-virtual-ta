## Types of values

[**[Course Image: Types of values]** The image presents a classification of data types crucial in data handling and archiving. It divides data values into three primary categories: Categorical, Numerical, and Composite. Categorical values include Boolean types (True/False), unordered sets (e.g., colors like Red, Blue, Green), and ordered sets (e.g., levels like Low, Medium, High). Understanding these data types is essential for correctly storing, retrieving, and analyzing data within an archive, as each type requires specific handling and processing methods to maintain data integrity.es", including categorical, numerical, and composite data types, all of which are critical to understand when creating an archive. Categorical values are further broken down into Boolean (True, False), Unordered (Red, Blue, Green) and Ordered (Low, Medium, High). A solid understanding of data types is foundational for managing and accessing the archived data effectively. Recognizing these data types helps ensure that archived data is structured and searchable in a way that meets the specific needs of a project or organization. The choice of data type can affect the storage space needed and also how the data can be analyzed.)](https://youtu.be/HlsqT0r9wAM)

- Categorical values may be:
 - Boolean: True or False
 - Unordered: No order, like colors
 - Ordered: Order, like ratings
 - Cyclical: Like days of the week
 - Unstructured: Like names, images
- Numerical values may be:
 - Integer: You can add or subtract
 - Real: You can multiply or divide
- Composite values have an internal structure
 - Temporal: Date, Time
 - Spatial: Latitude, Longitude, Shapefiles
 - Structured: JSON, XML with schema
 - Specialized: IP addresses, URLs, Email addresses, Phone numbers, etc.
