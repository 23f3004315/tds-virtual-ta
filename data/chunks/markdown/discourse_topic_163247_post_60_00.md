@Jivraj , @carlton Dear Sirs, I need help in solving this question. I have the same issue. I have tried tokenizer tool, tried writing request code but still couldnâ€™t get the correct answer. I have tried numerous time and ended up consuming lot of tokens . What should be the optimal approach in this question?
