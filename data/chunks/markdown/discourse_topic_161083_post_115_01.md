**[Discussion Image by 23f2003921]** This image represents a student's attempt to solve a SQL problem in a TDS (The Data Science path) discussion thread. The problem requires calculating the total sales for "Gold" tickets from a SQLite database table named "tickets" with columns "type", "units", and "price". The student submits the query `SELECT sum(units*price) FROM tickets WHERE type='gold' collate nocase;` but receives an "Error: Got [[124944.59]]..." message. The error suggests the student's query, while syntactically correct, isn't producing the desired result and the discussion includes guidance: "Get all rows where the Type is "Gold". Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as "Gold". Calculate the sales as Units * Price, and sum them up." This suggests the student needs to refine the query, possibly addressing case-insensitive comparisons and/or handling potential data inconsistencies in the "type" column. system to remind the student to handle variations of 'Gold' such as 'GOLD' or 'gold' and to calculate sales as Units * Price, then sum the result." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="e3EmF8yyEw2PO92Z0u3HmvrrcHs" width="690" height="305" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2003921]** This image is a student's attempt to solve a SQL problem from the TDS Jan 2025 GA1 Development Tools discussion thread. The problem asks to calculate the total sales of "Gold" tickets from a "tickets" table with columns 'type', 'units', and 'price'. The student's SQL query `SELECT sum(units*price) FROM tickets WHERE type='gold' COLLATE nocase;` attempts to sum the product of units and price for rows where the ticket type is 'gold', using `COLLATE nocase` for case-insensitive comparison, but results in an unspecified error containing `Error: Got [[124944.59]]`. The prompt in the bottom explains that the solution involves selecting all rows where the type is 'Gold' (case-insensitive and ignoring misspellings), calculating Units * Price for each, and summing these values., **[Discussion Image by 23f2003921]** This image depicts a student's attempt to solve a SQL query problem within the "GA1 - Development Tools - Discussion Thread" in a TDS course. The task is to calculate the total sales of "Gold" tickets from a SQLite database table named "tickets" with columns 'type', 'units', and 'price'. The student tries the query "select sum(units*price) from tickets where type='gold' collate nocase;". However, this query produces an "Error: Got [[124944.59]]...". The provided guidance suggests that the query should select rows where the 'Type' is "Gold", while being case-insensitive and ignoring misspellings. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2003921]** This image shows a student's SQL query attempt and resulting error within a TDS discussion thread. The student is trying to calculate the total sales of "Gold" tickets from a `tickets` table, which has columns `type`, `units`, and `price`, using the query `select sum(units*price) from tickets where type='gold' collate nocase;`. The error message "Error: Got [[124944.59]]..." indicates the query failed. The surrounding text gives the requirement to retrieve all rows where the 'Type' is "Gold" and ignore case and misspellings. This suggests that the collate nocase is not working to solve the issue. 2x" data-dominant-color="0E1010">image1269Ã—561 42 KB
