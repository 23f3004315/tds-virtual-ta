Hello Sir, thank you for changing the question.

@carlton I’m getting the below error:

`Words like https, webbed, impact are missing (or not separated as words). 
`
However, in the source PDF file itself these words are not available.

**[Discussion Image by 23f2005138]** This image shows a student likely receiving an error message while attempting to process text data, indicating a troubleshooting situation within the TDS GA4 data sourcing discussion. The error message states "Words like https, webbed, impact are missing (or not separated as words)," meaning the student's input is being flagged because it is not properly separated into individual words. The input consists of vertically separated words such as "quos", "utrum", "tredecim", "valetudo", "cras", "videlicet", "laudantium", "aetas", "canis", and "tantum", implying the system is having trouble identifying standard word boundaries or is expecting certain specific terms like "https," "webbed," and "impact" to be present and distinct. This likely requires the student to re-examine the input format to ensure proper word separation."Error: Words like https, webbed, impact are missing (or not separated as words)". The image displays a table-like structure with Latin words such as "quos", "utrum", "tredecim", etc., suggesting the student is likely processing or validating text data which involves identifying individual words; the red squiggly lines under some words may indicate misspellings or processing errors within the system the student is using. The error message indicates that certain expected keywords "https", "webbed", and "impact" are not found or are not properly delimited, which suggests an issue in how the data is being parsed or tokenized into individual words during data sourcing." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="llc2Am9hxee4AilF3VM8urBPdgt" width="657" height="106">image657×106 7.78 KB
