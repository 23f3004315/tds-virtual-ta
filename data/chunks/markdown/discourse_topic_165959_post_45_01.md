**[Discussion Image by 23f2004752]** This image captures a student's view of their GitHub Actions workflows within a repository, specifically from post #45 in the "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]". It appears to be a troubleshooting step, showing the "All workflows" page displaying the results of "Daily Commit Workflow" runs. The interface includes a search bar to "Filter workflow runs" and columns for "Event," "Status," "Branch," and "Actor." The student, Ansh205, has manually triggered these workflows, and the image shows that the most recent run (#4) was successful (green checkmark), while the previous three (#1, #2, #3) failed (red 'x'). The successful run occurred 5 minutes ago, while the failed runs were 37 minutes, 54 minutes, and 1 hour ago respectively, all running on the "main" branch. The image likely represents the student trying to diagnose why the previous workflow runs failed. execution of their "Daily Commit Workflow"." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-05 193233" data-base62-sha1="baSW7r7JEPDCDSsTsbJzL3Mk0W7" width="690" height="302" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2004752]** This image depicts a student's GitHub Actions workflow run history, likely part of a troubleshooting discussion related to setting up CI/CD for a data sourcing project in the TDS GA4 course. The screenshot shows the "All workflows" view, displaying four runs of a workflow named "Daily Commit Workflow", all triggered manually by user "Ansh205" on the "main" branch. The first run is marked with a green checkmark indicating success, while the other three runs are marked with a red "X" indicating failure. The student is likely seeking help understanding why the initial workflow runs failed before the successful one, as the timestamp shows they ran sequentially. The image shows UI elements like the workflow names, status indicators, branch, and time elapsed, providing context for debugging workflow configurations or code commits., **[Discussion Image by 23f2004752]** This image shows a student's view of the "All workflows" page in a project management or CI/CD platform, likely GitHub Actions, which is shared in a TDS GA4 Data Sourcing discussion thread. The student is viewing "Daily Commit Workflow" runs, with the runs listed in reverse chronological order, the runs are labeled #1 through #4 and manually run by the same user ("Ansh205"). The "Status" column reveals that the latest run (#4) was successful (green checkmark), while the previous three runs (#1-#3) all failed (red "x"). The table includes columns for "Event", "Branch" (all runs are on the "main" branch), "Actor" and time since the workflow was triggered and total time taken for the run. It is likely that the student is sharing this screenshot to illustrate an issue or ask a question about the workflow failures and subsequent success after a fix. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2004752]** This image shows a student's view of their GitHub Actions workflow runs, likely during a troubleshooting discussion in the TDS Jan 2025 cohort. The "All workflows" page displays four "Daily Commit Workflow" runs. The first entry, "Daily Commit Workflow #4", has a green checkmark indicating a successful run, while the other three ("#3", "#2", and "#1") have red "X" marks, indicating failures. The branch is "main" for all workflows, and they were all manually run by "Ansh205". The image provides context to a possible issue with workflow configuration or code changes that resulted in recent failures, possibly the focus of the student's question within the discussion thread. 2x" data-dominant-color="11161C">Screenshot 2025-02-05 1932331462×642 38.4 KB
