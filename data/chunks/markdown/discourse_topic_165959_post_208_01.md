**[Discussion Image by 23f3001601]** This image captures a student's question about a data sourcing assignment, specifically in the context of a StreamFlix content acquisition strategy. The student has entered JSON data containing the id, title, year, and rating of a movie, into a text box for submission. However, the submission has triggered an error message: "Error: At [10].year. Values don't match. Expected: "2021-". Actual: "2021"". The error indicates a discrepancy in the year field, where the expected value is "2021-" but the submitted value is "2025". A note suggests that IMDb data may vary by region or change over time, recommending manual translation or re-running the scraper code. The student is likely confused about the mismatch and needs to correct the year in the JSON data to match the expected value based on the assignment's requirements. results can vary by region and may need manual translation, also suggesting the student might need to re-run their scraper code. This implies the JSON data was probably obtained from IMDb and needs to be adjusted to match the required data." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="gnf0mFqKEEJbXQKZvPnuF42i1lE" width="690" height="283" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f3001601]** This image depicts a student submitting a JSON data payload as part of an assignment related to simulating content acquisition for a streaming service, StreamFlix.
