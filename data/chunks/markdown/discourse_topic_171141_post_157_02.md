 the embedding service is working correctly, but doesn't resolve the `curl` related issue. 2x" data-dominant-color="171717">Screenshot_2025-04-01-08-51-03-781_com.google.android.apps.docs1080×2340 253 KB

**[Discussion Image by 23f2005702]** This image shows a student's attempt to run a data generation task, resulting in multiple errors. The student is trying to save data to `/data/b10.csv`, but encounters an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error with detail "choices", followed by an HTTP 404 Not Found error when trying to read from `/data/b10.csv`, indicating the file was not saved successfully. The script also fails with a 429 "Too Many Requests" error when attempting to use the OpenAI API. The displayed output includes HTTP requests and associated error codes, along with the script execution command involving `datagen.py` and the student's email address as an argument. It suggests issues with both data saving and API usage within the student's data generation process, and potentially rate limiting on the OpenAI API.mail as an argument, potentially for data generation, indicating issues during project setup and execution." alt="Screenshot_2025-04-01-08-51-01-349_com.google.android.apps.docs" data-base62-sha1="znT50jIE99YegW4vR9yWjtcBrQ7" width="230" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2005702]** This image shows a student's (23f2005702@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) attempt to run a TDS project and the errors encountered. The errors include an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error with detail "choices", an HTTP 404 Not Found error when trying to read /data/b10.csv, indicating the file wasn't created or accessible, and a 429 Too Many Requests error from the OpenAI API, likely due to rate limiting. The student's task involved running a datasette to count rows in the 'tickets' table where 'type' is 'Bronze' and save it to /data/b10.csv, install "uv", and then execute a datagen.py script, which is all part of the task instruction. The script execution likely includes the datasette setup for query execution with saving to the "/data/b10.csv" file. The score of 1/20 indicates that the student is far from completing the task successfully., **[Discussion Image by 23f2005702]** This image depicts a student, 23f2005702, encountering multiple errors in a TDS project related to data processing and API requests. The errors include a "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error" with detail "choices", "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found" when trying to read "/data/b10.csv", and "HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests" when attempting to access the OpenAI API via a proxy. The script also fails to read a file located at `/data/b10.csv`, and indicates a task to install `uv` (if required) and run the datagen.py script from a GitHub gist using the student's email as an argument. The student's score is 1/20, suggesting significant issues with the project. The student appears to be running tasks involving querying a database, saving data to a CSV file, and interacting with an external API, experiencing server errors and file access problems in the process. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2005702]** This image captures a student's attempt to execute a data processing task within the TDS project environment, revealing multiple error messages. The student, identified as 23f2005702@ds.study.iitm.ac.in, is encountering issues with running a datasette server and accessing a specific file, "b10.csv". Initially, a POST request to localhost:8462 results in an "HTTP 500 Internal Server Error" with detail "'choices'", indicating a problem with the request parameters or server-side logic. Subsequently, a GET request to read the file /data/b10.csv returns an "HTTP 404 Not Found" error, suggesting the file either doesn't exist or is not accessible at the specified path, confirmed by the "B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv" message. Lastly, the student faces a "429 Too Many Requests" error when sending a request to the OpenAI API and the system is attempting to install 'uv' and run a script from Github, further indicating environment setup or API usage problems. 2x" data-dominant-color="141414">Screenshot_2025-04-01-08-51-01-349_com.google.android.apps.docs1080×2340 219 KB
