Same here sir, i only changed LICENSE to MIT LICENSE due to the mail i received.

The LICENSE file was already present in the repo as i submitted my project. The change too was made on the 16th of Feb.

Sir, I would highly appreciate if you consider it as the rest of the pre-requisites are working well.Due to this, the project is also not being evaulated.

Thankyou
