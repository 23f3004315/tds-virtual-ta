is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for learning sake. I had exams and would like do week 4,week 5 before week 6 and doing the assignment is a huge part in learning, any on the just doing the assignments or answers for the assignments? I understand that each set of students get different questions. @Jivraj @carlton @s.anand
