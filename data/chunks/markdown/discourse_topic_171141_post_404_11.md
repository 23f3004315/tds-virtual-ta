**[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image depicts a student's code execution in VS Code, showing the "Tds-official-Project1" discrepancy. The student is running `evaluate.py` using `uv` and providing an email and token, likely as part of an automated evaluation process for the TDS project. The terminal output reveals a series of HTTP requests, including a failing POST request resulting in a 400 error with the detail "name 'HTTPException' is not defined." Task A1 passes, but task A2 fails with a "WinError 2: The system cannot find the file specified" error, and furthermore another task runs to count the number of thursdays in a datelist. The file structure is visible in the explorer on the left including a `.env` file containing the AIPROXY_TOKEN and various python files in the llmagent directory. with file paths or imports within the project, and A1 is passing. The description is intended to help other students recognize and troubleshoot similar environment and file handling issues." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="dCf5SPGmN96pXgVqQb2UwLcUaaZ" width="690" height="396" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image captures a student's attempt to run the `evaluate.py` script for a project, resulting in multiple errors. The student's VS Code editor shows the project file structure on the left, and the `.env` file containing the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is open. The terminal output reveals an HTTP 400 error with the detail "name 'HTTPException' is not defined," indicating an issue within the API call or data processing. Task A1 passed, but A2 failed with a "[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified" error, suggesting a file path problem or missing file. The student's final running task involves counting Thursdays in 'data/datefile.txt', which further highlights issues with file handling or access permissions., **[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image captures a student's terminal output in VS Code while running the `evaluate.py` script for the TDS (presumably "The Data Science") project, revealing a peer discussion. The student executes the command `uv run evaluate.py` with email, token counter, and external port arguments. The output shows that Task A1 passed, but Task A2 failed with a `WinError 2: The system cannot find the file specified` error, and also a `HTTP 400` error with `name 'HTTPException' is not defined`, indicating problems related to file access and potentially missing exception handling in the student's code. The student also has the `.env` file open showing the AIPROXY_TOKEN variable. The file explorer shows that the student is working on project "llmagent" which includes datagen.py, evaluate.py, tasksA.py and tasksB.py. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image shows a student's attempt to run the `evaluate.py` script, likely as part of a TDS project, displaying a mix of successful and failed tasks. The student is executing the script with email, token counter, and external port arguments. The terminal output shows that task A1 passed, but task A2 failed with a "WinError 2: The system cannot find the file specified" error, and there's an HTTP 400 error indicating that "HTTPException" is not defined, suggesting a potential issue with the API proxy or the task's code. The image also shows the contents of the `.env` file, containing the API proxy token, and other project files like `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `Dockerfile`, etc. The student is also encountering issues with another task involving counting the number of Thursdays from `/data/datefile.txt` and writing the count to `/data/dates-thursdays.txt`. 2x" data-dominant-color="202020">image1694Ã—974 55.5 KB
