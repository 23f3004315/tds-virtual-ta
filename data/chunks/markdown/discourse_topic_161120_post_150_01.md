**[Discussion Image by 21f3000745]** This image shows a student accessing a deployed application on Vercel and inspecting the API response, which suggests a peer discussion or troubleshooting situation. The URL, "new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api?name=Mn&name=m", indicates the student is passing query parameters "name" with potentially conflicting values ("Mn" and "m") to the API endpoint. The JSON response, "{"marks": [5,78]}", is displayed in the browser, likely after the student has interacted with the application. The presence of the "Pretty-print" checkbox suggests the student might be using a browser extension or built-in feature to format the JSON response for readability. This could represent a student sharing their API result for feedback, or trying to understand why they receive this specific response when passing these query parameters.me=Mn&name=m`, suggesting the student is trying to pass the "name" parameter twice with different values ("Mn" and "m"). The response from the API is the JSON payload `{"marks": [5,78]}`, which is displayed in the browser, indicating a successful but potentially unexpected result from the API. The student might be testing how the API handles multiple identical query parameters, or might be unintentionally passing the same parameter multiple times. It appears the "Pretty-print" checkbox is unchecked, thus the raw JSON output is shown. This is likely a student question about the behavior observed, or a demonstration of an unexpected outcome." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="caioHSPUXPZToTKPMTlNFp29YKE" width="690" height="204" data-dominant-color="F3E6D6">image717Ã—212 8.67 KB
