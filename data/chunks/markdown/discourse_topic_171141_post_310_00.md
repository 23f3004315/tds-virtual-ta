## Post #310 by Santoshsharma

Respected Sir,

I hope you’re all doing well. I’m writing regarding my Project 1 evaluation, as I’ve encountered a discrepancy that I’d like some help with.

According to the evaluation email I received, my score was 0 for all the tasks with an additional bonus of 1 (totaling a P1 score of 1). However, when I ran the provided evaluation script before my submission, I got 7 in Phase A. Additionally, after reviewing the Docker logs, evaluation logs, and the p1_evaluation_error_logs (from the linked Google Sheets), I couldn’t find any reference to my roll number.

Could someone please help me investigate this issue? I’d really appreciate any guidance from the evaluation team.

Thank you for your time and assistance!
