[Quote]: 
I would like to highlight an issue regarding the evaluation of the TDS Solver Project 2.

[Quote]: 
As per the official project instructions, our API was clearly required to handle **POST** requests at /api/ with multipart/form-data.

[Quote]: 
Nowhere in the documentation was it mentioned that the API should handle **GET** requests.

[Quote]: 
However, during evaluation, GET requests seem to be made to the endpoint, leading to **405 Method Not Allowed** errors.

[Quote]: 
These errors are expected behavior for an API that is properly built to accept only POST, exactly as per the project guidelines.

[Quote]: 
Therefore, I request that the evaluation team **only test using POST requests** as originally instructed.

[Quote]: 
Penalizing students because of unnecessary GET requests would be **unfair and incorrect** based on the project requirements.

[Quote]: 
Please ensure that evaluation happens strictly according to the provided instructions.
