## Week Summary

[**[Course Image: Discover the Data - Summary]** The image introduces the "Discover the Data" component of the TDS course, focusing on tools in data science. It serves as a summary for the week's learning, likely covering techniques and methods for data exploration and understanding, which is crucial before archiving data. This involves using specialized schemas to identify elements like IP addresses, URLs, and email addresses for subsequent archiving. The image also highlights the initial stages of data analysis, emphasizing the importance of understanding the data's structure and content before it is stored or managed in an archive. Students should understand that data discovery enables effective archiving strategies and efficient retrieval when needed. "Discover the Data" as part of the Tools in Data Science curriculum, focusing on using data analysis techniques to gain insights. It suggests exploring various methods to find patterns and extract meaningful information from datasets, visually represented by sketches of graphs, charts, and idea symbols. The image serves as a visual introduction to the module on data exploration, encouraging students to approach data with curiosity and a goal to uncover valuable insights. The intention is to prepare students to choose appropriate tools and techniques for data discovery and analysis in future projects.)](https://youtu.be/NNiFxgANu8Y)

Based on what you have learnt in this module, you should be able to do two things: find data and understand what type of data it is.

Both of these are powerful skills.

The more data you are able to find, the more analysis that you will be able to do that others are unable to.
Therefore, discovering new sources of data is a competitive advantage and a skill that is well worth building.

The other, in terms of understanding the type of data, will give you an edge in terms of knowing which data set is easier to work with.
Structured data is easier to work with because you don't have to do any additional work.
You don't have to extract information from it.
Numerical values are easier to work with than, let's say, categorical or composite because there's less effot to extract the structure.
So you'll be able to compare two data sets and say that one gets more results by spending in less time and effort.
