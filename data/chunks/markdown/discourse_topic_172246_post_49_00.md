@s.anand Sir,

I just wanted to request you to kindly look into the matter regarding the GA7 peer review bonus marks. Many of us are still waiting for a response on Discourse, and itâ€™s becoming a bit concerning. Would really appreciate it if you could help us get some clarity on this.

Thank you!
