Ranking and Filtering Data**: Use SQL and Pandas to rank arrival delays by distance and extract key insights, such as the earliest flight arrival for each route.
- **Joining Data**: Create a cost analysis by joining datasets and calculating total costs of flight delays, demonstrating DuckDB's speed in joining and aggregating large datasets.

Here are the links used in the video:

- [Data analysis with DuckDB - Notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y9XSs-LeSz-ZmnQj4OGP-Q4yDkPJrmsZ/view)
- [Parquet file format](https://parquet.apache.org/) - a fast columnar storage format that's becoming a de facto standard for big data
- [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) - a fast in-memory database that's very good with large-scale analysis
- [Plotly Datasets](https://github.com/plotly/datasets/) - a collection of sample datasets for analysis. This includes the [Kaggle Flights Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays) that the notebook downloads as [2015_flights.parquet](https://github.com/plotly/datasets/raw/master/2015_flights.parquet)
