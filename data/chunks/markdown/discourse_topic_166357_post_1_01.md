**[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image depicts a student's attempt to query a local server at `127.0.0.1:8000/execute` to retrieve the status of a ticket using the query: `query=what%20is%20the%20status%20of%20ticket`. The server responds with a JSON error message indicating a "missing" field, specifically related to the "query" parameter, which is flagged as "Field required." The error message suggests that while the student included the `query` parameter in the URL, the server expects the actual value or content of the query to be provided, not just a description of the desired information. The "input" is shown as "null," reinforcing the missing input value. Thus, the student needs to ensure the query parameter contains the actual ticket ID or relevant information for the server to process.PI requires a different way to provide the actual query value, and the "input" is null to confirm the missing information. The error message shows that the student is attempting to determine "what is the status of ticket," but the system requires the query in a format it can recognize." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-05 182750" data-base62-sha1="uO2IMULv8781t3KaxFm3cnClrsx" width="690" height="366" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image depicts a student encountering an error while trying to execute a query in a web application, specifically related to questions Q7 or Q8. The browser address bar shows the URL `127.0.0.1:8000/execute?query=what%20is%20the%20status%20of%20ticket`, indicating an attempt to fetch the status of a ticket. The server response, formatted as a JSON, contains a "detail" array with an error message indicating a "missing" "query" parameter, and the message "Field required" with a null input. This suggests the application expects a specific query parameter ("q") that is not being passed correctly in the URL, causing the execution to fail due to a required field being absent. The student is likely confused about how to properly format the query parameter in the URL to include the "q" field., **[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image depicts a student's attempt to use a local API endpoint, `127.0.0.1:8000/execute`, by constructing a query string in the URL. The query string, `query=what%20is%20the%20status%20of%20ticket`, appears to be a natural language question. However, the API returns a JSON response indicating a "missing" field error. The error specifies that the "query" and "q" fields are required, suggesting that the API expects a structured query, not just natural language input. The "msg" field indicates "Field required," and "input" is null, confirming that the API did not receive the expected input in the correct format. The student seems to be facing difficulty in understanding how to properly structure the query for the API endpoint. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image depicts a student question regarding a "Field required" error encountered while using a TDS application, specifically related to Q7 or Q8 of a task. The error is shown in JSON format and indicates a missing 'query' parameter ('q') when making a request to the `/execute` endpoint on `127.0.0.1:8000`. The URL in the address bar shows the attempted query `query=what%20is%20the%20status%20of%20ticket`, suggesting the student intended to fetch the status of a ticket but didn't provide a specific ticket identifier. The error message "Field required" and `input: null` indicates that the 'q' parameter, representing the actual ticket number or identifier, is missing from the request. This means the student needs to include the ticket number itself in the query to get the status. 2x" data-dominant-color="1C1E1B">Screenshot 2025-02-05 1827501917Ã—1018 38.3 KB
