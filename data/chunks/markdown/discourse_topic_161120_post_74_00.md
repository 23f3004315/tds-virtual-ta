Hi Srividhya,

This error is because you are trying to access a feature of ngrok which requires to pay ERR_NGROK_501 | ngrok documentation.

I think you didnâ€™t use authtoken to authenticate through your laptop. Follow second step on this page Quickstart | ngrok documentation to authenticate.

kind regards

Jivraj
