 found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint.

How should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn’t help.

Also, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions. I can improve a lot and add the remaining questions, but the constraint is the 31st March deadline. Most students, including myself, will only get time after 30th March due to Viva and OPPE.

It would be really helpful if the TDS team could extend the deadline.

I believe it would strike a good balance—team made us wait for the Project 1 results, but extending the Project 2 deadline would make up for that for some extent. Its request nothing else.
