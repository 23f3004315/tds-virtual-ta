**[Discussion Image by 23f2004313]** This image depicts a student attempting to answer a question in the "GA5 - Data Preparation" discussion thread. The task involves cleaning and analyzing sales data to calculate the total margin for transactions meeting specific criteria (date, product, country), based on a provided Excel file ("q-clean-up-excel-sales-data.xlsx"). The student has entered "0.0" as the answer, but the system returns an "Error: Incorrect answer" message, along with a hint that the margin should be entered as a percentage (e.g., 12.34%) or decimal (e.g., 0.1234). The image shows the student's input box, the error message, and the instructions for the task, including the formula for calculating the total margin.. The task is to calculate the total margin for transactions before a specified date (Tue Jun 14 2022 04:52:52 GMT+0530), for the product "Theta" sold in the US, given a messy Excel dataset. The student has entered "0.0" as the answer and received an "Error: Incorrect answer" message, with a hint indicating that the margin should be entered as a percentage or a decimal. The assignment requires data cleaning steps, including standardizing date formats, extracting product names, cleaning sales and cost values, and handling missing cost data." alt="{5C759A23-7CA1-4955-9D41-41F8E33D28E2}" data-base62-sha1="y9TVdBwIFFVgCI0VPNuy8qkoX1z" width="528" height="500" data-dominant-color="2E3237">{5C759A23-7CA1-4955-9D41-41F8E33D28E2}830Ã—785 51.9 KB
