2nd process ( This one is Json object)

**[Discussion Image by lakshaygarg654]** This image shows a student's code snippet and its output within the "Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread". The code imports the `json` library, then defines a dictionary `my_response` containing a key "answer" with the value "26272" (as a string). The code then accesses and prints the value associated with the "answer" key using `print(my_response["answer"])`, resulting in the output "26272". This demonstrates the student accessing a value from a dictionary using the key. The student seems to be demonstrating how to extract the answer from a dictionary response.alue from a dictionary. The code first imports the `json` library, then defines a dictionary named `my_response` which has one key-value pair: `"answer"` with the value `"26272"`. Finally, the code prints the value associated with the key `"answer"` in the dictionary `my_response` using `print(my_response["answer"])`. The output shown below the code confirms that the value "26272" is successfully printed to the console. This illustrates a simple dictionary access operation in Python." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="iUFZH1xlYH3LdVBhmOwnJ1wzzlc" width="514" height="193">image514×193 3.61 KB

or both are incorrect?
