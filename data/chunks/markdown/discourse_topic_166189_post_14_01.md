**[Discussion Image by 22f3000585]** This image, within a student discussion about assignment submission issues, shows a user interface element displaying "Recent saves." Specifically, it displays three recent saves with a "Reload" button for each. Each save lists the date and time (2/2/2025, with times ranging from 9:04:51 PM to 9:04:58 PM) and a score of "4." This suggests a troubleshooting step of potentially reloading a recent save to address the assignment submission problem, with the low score perhaps being a contributing factor to the issue. The student might be trying to determine if using one of these saves helps with the submission.abeled "Recent saves" and displays three save entries. Each entry shows a "Reload" button, followed by the timestamp of the save (all on February 2, 2025 at different times in the 9:04 PM hour) and the corresponding score (all with a score of 4). The student likely provided this image as part of a discussion about assignment submission issues, potentially related to how scores or saves are being handled." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="bHjtQ60wOL2wEIVXvst6qkVbToK" width="547" height="258">image547×258 12.3 KB
