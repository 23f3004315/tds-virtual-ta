**[Discussion Image by Divya1]** This image shows a student question during the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion regarding GitHub Actions. The student, Divya1, is attempting to create a GitHub Action where one of the steps' names includes their email address, as instructed: `23f3001255@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. The provided YAML example shows a job named "test" with a step that includes the email address in the `name` field and executes `echo "Hello, world!"`. However, when the student enters their repository URL, `https://github.com/divya23f3001255/divya.github.io`, they receive an error: "Error: No step matches 23f3001255@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". The error suggests the system cannot find a GitHub Action step that matches the email address provided, indicating a potential misunderstanding of how the email matching is implemented or an issue with the platform's validation. The student likely needs clarification on the exact requirements of the email address matching within the GitHub Action workflow.ps is named after her email address, "23f3001255@ds.study.iitm.ac.in," as instructed. She has provided the YAML code snippet defining a job "test" with a step named after her email address, and has attempted to trigger the action with the repository URL "https://github.com/divya23f3001255/divya.github.io." However, the system returns an error, "Error: No step matches 23f3001255@ds.study.iitm.ac.in," indicating a mismatch between the expected step name and what was actually found or processed, likely during validation or execution. The instructions are to make sure the *name* of one of the steps contains the student's email address; the validation is likely expecting the student to enter the *repository URL* to match the step name, which is incorrect, leading to the error." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="61mXwvcNCh5lrozWJsG830TSWty" width="690" height="286" data-dominant-color="1E2227">image1157Ã—481 16.2 KB
