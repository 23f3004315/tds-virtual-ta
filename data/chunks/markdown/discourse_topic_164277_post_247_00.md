## Post #247 by 23f2001286

**Direct Link**: [Post #247](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/164277/247)

A silly Doubt though but still a doubt!

Could we create an image first of our project in initial stage(ie the my “app.py” is not completely ready) but I have build an docker image including the app.py and other dependencies.

Should I give the same url now and then carry on updating the app.py

Or, Should first complete and then upload in the form!

plz reply!!
