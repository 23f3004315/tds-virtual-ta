I am unable to open the files shared by the students I am peer reviewing as I don’t have access to them on my student email. Since we were asked to give access to se2002@study.iitm.ac.in when submitting, I wanted to check how this will work—will the team provide us access, or do we need to request it from the student and wait for them to grant it?"
