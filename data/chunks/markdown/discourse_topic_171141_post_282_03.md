**[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image shows the GitHub repository "tds-project1" owned by user "GaURaVinDeX," indicating a student project. The repository's file structure is visible, including files such as '__pycache__', '.gitignore', 'Dockerfile', 'LICENSE', 'app.py', 'requirements.txt', 'tasksA.py', and 'tasksB.py'. An "Add a README" prompt is displayed at the bottom, suggesting that a README file has not yet been added to the repository. The repository is set to public visibility with the main branch, one branch in total, and no tags. The file list suggests the project is likely a Python-based application, given the presence of .py files and requirements.txt.guage statistics indicate it's primarily Python (98%) with some Dockerfile (2%) usage. The screenshot is likely a student's initial project setup on GitHub and forms the context for a discussion regarding discrepancies, possibly about the expected files or setup instructions." alt="Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 10.44.24 AM" data-base62-sha1="1QdmND2RTCa9GGGlQ6Ppunr9gMS" width="690" height="372" srcset="**[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image depicts a student's (GaURaVinDeX) GitHub repository named "tds-project1," likely related to a TDS (Thoughtful Data Science) project, and appears to be shared as a screenshot in a peer discussion. The repository includes common files such as `__pycache__`, `.gitignore`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`, with all files showing an "Initial commit" from "2 months ago" attributed to GaURaVinDeX. The UI shows the main branch selected, and there is a prominent call to action to "Add a README" to help people understand the project. The right sidebar shows that the repository is MIT licensed, has no description, 0 stars, 1 watcher, and uses Python (98%) and Dockerfile (2%) as the primary languages., **[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image shows the file structure of the GitHub repository "tds-project1" owned by user "GaURaVinDeX," which appears to be related to a project. The files present in the repository include Python scripts (app.py, tasksA.py, tasksB.py), a Dockerfile, a requirements.txt file (likely for Python dependencies), a .gitignore file, a LICENSE file, and a __pycache__ directory. The repository is public, has 1 branch (main), and the most recent commit was made 2 months prior. The interface shows options to add a file, view code, and indicates no README has been added yet. It also shows a language breakdown of 98% Python and 2% Dockerfile and suggests a Python workflow configuration. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image shows the GitHub repository "tds-project1" owned by user "GaURaVinDeX", serving as the context for a student discussion about discrepancies in TDS Project 1. The repository contains standard project files such as `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`, `Dockerfile`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, and `__pycache__`. The student is in the "Code" tab, viewing the project's file structure, and GitHub prompts them to "Add a README" to help people understand the project. This view provides insight into the initial project setup and the files present, which may be used to understand student questions about the project structure. The repository has an MIT License and is primarily written in Python with some Dockerfile code. 2x" data-dominant-color="F8F9F9">Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 10.44.24 AM3324Ã—1794 497 KB
