COPY .env /app/` is highlighted, indicating this might be a point of discussion or confusion. 2x" data-dominant-color="2E2C2B">Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 11.12.18 am754Ã—302 41 KB

This is because if you look at your Dockerfile .env does not exist in your repo.

Therefore it does not build.

Your docker is supposed to take the AIPROXY token from our environment not from yours.

This is passed dynamically at runtime of the Docker.

Since it fails to build, we cannot evaluate it.

Kind regards
