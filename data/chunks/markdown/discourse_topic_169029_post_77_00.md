Will it be

“file=binary of zipfile/csv/json” for the first type and
“file=**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** The image displays a simple scene rendered on a black background, potentially from a graphics library or application related to the TDS Solver project. It features a red square and a green circle positioned near the top, above a horizontal blue line. Below the blue line, a yellow triangle is placed toward the bottom center of the image. The image likely represents a basic test case or output of the TDS solver, showcasing its ability to render different shapes with distinct colors. This could be a visual aid for debugging or demonstrating the functionality of the solver within the project discussion. The simple shapes suggest the discussion might involve initial rendering tests or validation of geometric element handling.” for the second type

Files will be exactly same as GA assignment, if there is url then it will be a url and if it get’s downloaded by clicking then it will come from requester’s machine.

so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the “question” attribute and the image in the “file” attribute?
