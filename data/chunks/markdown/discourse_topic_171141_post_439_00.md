## Post #439 by carlton

We used some internal parameters with weights to auto calculate the bonus. Unless your submission met that threshold of 0.5 after scaling you would not get any bonus. Your score was normalised so instead of 3 you got 4 (3.75 got rounded up). But the metrics used to evaluate the quality of your submission only scored you at 0.007 which is far below the threshold required to get a bonus.
