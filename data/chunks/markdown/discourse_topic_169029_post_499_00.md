## Post #499 by Aryxn

Project 2 marks are showing 0 for me, when I checked logs no requests were made to my endpoint. Could you please check into this, and update as soon as possible?

Getting marks in this project would help me to pass this sub. Also, please check if evaluation has been done for my endpoint or not.

Thank you
