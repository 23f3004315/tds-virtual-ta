**[Discussion Image by Deepanshutomar]** This image shows a student's question about JSON data within the "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread" on TDS. The student asks "What is the JSON data?" and then provides what looks like a JSON snippet, including fields like "id", "title", "year", and potentially "rating" but the last field is cut off. However, an error message appears below indicating a mismatch: "Error: At [10].year: Values don't match. Expected: "2025-". Actual: "2025-"". This suggests a validation process is in place expecting a "2025-" format for the year, while the student's data is providing "2025-". The student appears to be struggling with a data validation issue within the GA4 context.ing error due to this discrepancy." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-08 at 7.41.55 PM" data-base62-sha1="eEPdjSkv3AoGsKs6bmjwZVZLrmR" width="690" height="112" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Deepanshutomar]** This image depicts a student's question regarding JSON data within the TDS "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]". The student presented a snippet of JSON data containing "id", "title", "year", and a partially visible "rating" field. An error message is displayed below the code, indicating a data validation issue in the "year" field. The error message states "Error: At [10].year: Values don't match. Expected: '2025-'. Actual: '2025-'". This highlights a discrepancy where the expected year format includes a trailing dash, while the actual data lacks this dash. It appears the student needs to adjust the data to match the required format, likely by adding a hyphen at the end of the year value., **[Discussion Image by Deepanshutomar]** This image depicts a student's question regarding JSON data within the "GA4 - Data Sourcing" discussion thread, where the student is encountering an error. The student provides a snippet of JSON data containing fields like "id", "title", "year", and "rating." An error message indicates a mismatch in the "year" field at index [10], stating "Values don't match. Expected: '2025- '. Actual: '2025-'". This reveals that the data validation expects a specific format for the "year" value (possibly "2025- "), but the actual value provided is slightly different ("2025-"). The resolution would involve correcting the "year" field in the JSON data to match the expected format to eliminate this validation error. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Deepanshutomar]** This image captures a student's question within the TDS Jan 2025 "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread," specifically around a JSON data issue. The student provides a snippet of JSON data containing fields like "id", "title", "year", and "rating" for a movie. The system flags an error: "At [10].year: Values don't match. Expected: "2025- ". Actual: "2025-"." This suggests the system expected the "year" value to be "2025- " but received "2025-", pointing towards a mismatch involving a trailing space in expected vs actual JSON data values. The student is likely facing data validation errors because of this subtle discrepancy. 2x" data-dominant-color="26282C">Screenshot 2025-02-08 at 7.41.55 PM2576Ã—420 32.3 KB
