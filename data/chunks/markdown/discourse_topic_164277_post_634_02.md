**[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image captures a student's GitHub Codespaces dashboard view in the "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent" discussion. A prominent warning message is displayed indicating the student has reached 100% of their included Codespaces usage for the current billing period. The message also provides a link to the "billing settings" for more information, likely to review usage details or consider upgrading the plan. This suggests the student may need to manage their Codespaces usage more efficiently or potentially face charges for exceeding the included limit. The presence of "Go to docs" and "New codespace" buttons implies the student is likely in a learning or development phase of the project. This is a typical student question on resource usage that requires checking billing settings and optimizing code to minimize resource consumption.r advice in the discussion forum." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-17 200414" data-base62-sha1="v7KT6Bv6VbMQ4cwdgqIslIbAfsK" width="690" height="103" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image shows a student's view within the GitHub Codespaces interface, indicating a potential issue related to resource usage during the TDS project. The error message displayed in a red box states: "You're at 100% of your included usage for this billing period. For more information, view your billing settings." This suggests the student has exhausted the allotted free usage for Codespaces within the current billing cycle. This is a student's potential confusion point, indicating that the student needs to understand and manage resource usage within the Codespaces environment or consult their billing settings.

The notification displays an exclamation point icon and the message "You're at 100% of your included usage for this billing period. For more information, view your billing settings.", with "billing settings" as a clickable link. This typically indicates that the student may need to either upgrade their plan or manage their resource consumption to avoid additional charges. The student likely posted this to ask for guidance on managing Codespaces usage, and whether there are ways to optimize it within the project constraints. A response could include ways to check consumption details, manage active environments, and adjust billing options. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image from a student discussion shows a notification in the user's codespaces that they have reached 100% of their included usage for the billing period. It seems the student is likely posting a question related to this limit. The notification includes a link to the user's billing settings for more information, suggesting a first step for troubleshooting would be to review these settings. This image captures a potential student confusion point around resource limits in the cloud development environment. Students may need guidance on managing their usage or understanding the implications of exceeding their included allowance. 2x" data-dominant-color="221F24">Screenshot 2025-02-17 2004141338×200 18.2 KB
