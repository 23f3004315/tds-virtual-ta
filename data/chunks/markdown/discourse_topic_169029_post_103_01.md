 would be the same for everyone, and only the parameters in the questions would vary. However, I have noticed that the files can actually be different. To support this, I’m attaching screenshots of the CSV files for GA5 Q1—one is mine, and the other belongs to a batchmate.

**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image presents a sample dataset as part of a student discussion for "Project 2 - TDS Solver." The dataset is structured as a table containing information on transactions, with columns such as TransactionID, Customer Name, Country, Date, Product/Code, Sales, and Cost. The columns contain sample data like TransactionID 0001 for Customer John Doe from France on date 10-13-2023 with Product/Code "Eta/fzflrq" and Sales and Cost values. This type of dataset is common in data analysis and software development projects, often used for testing and demonstration purposes, and would likely be involved in implementing the TDS solver.such as TransactionID, Customer Name, Country, Date, Product/Code, Sales, and Cost. The columns display data related to sales transactions including names, countries, dates, product codes, sales amounts and associated costs. The data presents an example of the kind of data the TDS solver needs to handle. This could be a reference to data quality, expected data structure, or edge case handling within the solver." alt="mydata" data-base62-sha1="qYetz4niRz4sSTi8LqLpF7X9Gs3" width="690" height="294" data-dominant-color="E9E9EA">mydata939×401 18.3 KB
