The screenshot shows the Vercel project dashboard, specifically under the "Project" tab and displays a "Production Deployment" view with the URL being `https://vercel.com/jivraj-18s-projects/api`. A significant portion of the display area shows a "Not Found" error, indicating that the requested URL was not found on the server. The right side of the screen shows deployment information, including the deployment ID (`api-6xs8fp81c-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app`), the domain (`api-ruby-seven-48.vercel.app` with "+2" indicating additional domains), the "Ready" status created on "28 Jan by jivraj-18", and links to "View code" and the "vercel deploy" command used for deployment. The student is likely experiencing issues with the API endpoint not being accessible, despite the deployment appearing to be successful and ready.uration issue within the deployed application, potentially related to the API endpoint setup. The image also shows buttons for "Build Logs" and "Runtime Logs" which could be helpful to diagnose the error." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="xoXGezoYCPN7WUGnT52ZEQSCH1o" width="690" height="317" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image depicts a student's deployment issue on Vercel.

The Vercel dashboard shows that the "Production Deployment" is in a "Ready" status, having been created on January 28th by Jivraj-18, with deployment URL api-6xs8fp81c-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app, but the endpoint itself is returning a 404 error as indicated by "Not Found" message.
