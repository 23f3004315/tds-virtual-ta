**[Discussion Image by 23f2001413]** This image depicts a student's attempt to answer a question in the TDS Jan 2025 GA4 course, specifically related to data sourcing and weather data extraction. The assignment asks the student to use the BBC Weather API to fetch weather forecasts for London, extract the `issueDate` and `enhancedweatherDescription`, and create a JSON object where the date is the key and description the value. An example output is provided. The student has entered a JSON object containing weather forecasts for several dates in February 2025. However, upon checking, an error message "Error: At root: Property name mismatch" is displayed, indicating an issue with the structure or content of the submitted JSON data in relation to expected field names or data types. The student seems to be struggling with correctly structuring the JSON output as required by the prompt.e JSON. The student will likely need to review the expected output format and the API response to identify and correct the mismatch." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="VjEHbVA73iao6V0dWooc7VyFI6" width="690" height="350" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2001413]** This image shows a student's attempt to answer a question in the TDS "GA4 - Data Sourcing" course, specifically a data transformation task involving the BBC Weather API. The task requires fetching weather forecasts for London, extracting the `issueDate` and `enhancedWeatherDescription`, and creating a JSON object where the `issueDate` is the key and the `enhancedWeatherDescription` is the value. The student provides a JSON-like object with weather forecasts for several dates in February 2025, but receives an error message "Error: At root: Property name mismatch" after clicking the "Check" button, indicating an issue with the formatting or property names within the submission based on the requested structure from task 3. The expected JSON structure is shown as an example with dates in January 2025. This suggests the student needs to review the expected output format and ensure their submitted JSON structure precisely matches the required `issueDate: enhancedWeatherDescription` key-value pair structure., **[Discussion Image by 23f2001413]** This image depicts a student's attempt to answer a question related to data sourcing and transformation using the BBC Weather API within the TDS Jan 2025 course. The task involves retrieving weather data for London, extracting specific fields (issueDate and enhancedWeatherDescription), and constructing a JSON object representing the forecast. The image displays the student's JSON output for London's weather forecast, which includes dates from "2025-02-17" to "2025-02-21" and corresponding weather descriptions. However, the "Check" button reveals an error: "Error: At root: Property name mismatch", indicating that the structure or property names in the submitted JSON do not match the expected format. The provided example output at the top shows "issueDate" as the key and "enhancedWeatherDescription" as the value, which likely aligns with the expected JSON structure. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2001413]** This image depicts a student attempting a JSON data transformation task, specifically extracting weather forecast data for London from the BBC Weather API and formatting it into a JSON object. The task involves retrieving data using API calls, extracting the `issueDate` and `enhancedweatherDescription`, and then creating a JSON structure where the `issueDate` serves as the key and the `enhancedweatherDescription` as the value. The student has provided a JSON object with weather descriptions for dates in February 2025, but the "Check" button reveals an error: "At root: Property name mismatch," indicating an issue with the structure or naming conventions used in the submitted JSON. The example output shown earlier in the problem description shows the expected format. This is a question and answer interaction, where the automated checker is providing feedback on the student's answer. 2x" data-dominant-color="222C2E">image1788Ã—908 77.9 KB
