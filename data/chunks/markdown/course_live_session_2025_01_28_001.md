 later.

**Q3: DeepSeek is in the news. Does that affect the course?**

**A3:** Not really. The core concept remains the same: using LLMs as agents. The workflow is similar whether you use OpenAI, Anthropic, Copilot, or other AI tools.

**Q4: What is the concept behind Project One?**

---

**A4:** Project One involves creating an automated continuous integration pipeline. Data comes into a server, and various tasks are performed, many of which are repetitive. The goal is to automate some of this process to reduce errors and produce structured output. Your job is to build an API that handles these tasks using an LLM.

**Q5: What kind of tasks can I expect?**

**A5:** There are roughly 10 tasks in Phase A, which should be straightforward. In Phase B, the tasks are less well-defined, testing your system's ability to handle unexpected requests. The API should have two endpoints: "run" and "read". The "run" endpoint receives a task description (in plain English), processes it, and creates output files. The "read" endpoint retrieves the contents of a specified file.

**Q6: In GA1, the videos and questions aren't showing after the submission deadline. Can they be shown?**

**A6:** I'll inform Anand. The videos should still be available on the Tools in Data Science portal. They're from this section.

**Q7: Why are the videos and questions integrated into the GA itself?**

**A7:** Based on past data, students often go straight to the assignments without reviewing the content. Integrating the content into the GA is a better way to ensure they see it.

**Q8: I'm struggling with the project. The concepts are confusing. Could you present a model project and explain things step-by-step?**

**A8:** Yes, we'll do that in future sessions. We'll work through a working prototype of the project to illustrate each step. The project only uses material from the first three weeks of the course. If you're thorough with that material, you should be able to complete the project. It seems there's a knowledge gap, but I have full faith you can handle it. We'll address that gap in future sessions, starting with the basics.

**Q9: I'm having trouble with Git and GitHub. Is there support available?**

**A9:** Yes, we'll provide as much support as possible. We'll also go through a working prototype in future sessions. If you're struggling with Git, you won't be able to do the project, as it's a prerequisite. We'll create a repository during a future session so you can see how it's done.

**Q10: What's required for grading?**
