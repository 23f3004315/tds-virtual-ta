**[Discussion Image by karthiksirimilla]** This image shows an email received by a student regarding the prerequisite evaluations for TDS Project 1. The email details the five requirements, including having a public GitHub repository, an MIT license, a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image that runs via podman with specific environment variables and port mapping (podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME), and using the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository. The evaluation results show that the Docker image and GitHub repo are present and public, and the MIT license is present, but the Dockerfile is missing from the root of the GitHub repo, causing the prerequisites to fail and the Project 1 score to be 0. This indicates a student question or a problem with the submission requiring the student to ensure the Dockerfile is correctly located in the repository's root directory.g a FAIL status for the prerequisites and a project score of 0. The student needs to ensure the Dockerfile is located in the root directory of their GitHub repository to pass this prerequisite check." alt="IMG_6417" data-base62-sha1="1uIRebCprKWS8VSClyptr3riMaG" width="230" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by karthiksirimilla]** This image captures a student's email showing the results of pre-requisite checks for Project 1. The email outlines the five requirements for Project 1, including a publicly accessible GitHub repository, an MIT license, a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image that runs via podman, and consistent use of the same Dockerfile. The student received "PASS" for the Docker image and GitHub repository being present and public, and for the presence of an MIT license. However, the check "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo" resulted in "FAIL," causing the overall prerequisites to fail and the Project 1 score to be 0. The student needs to ensure a Dockerfile is in the root directory of their GitHub repository to resolve this issue., **[Discussion Image by karthiksirimilla]** This image is a snippet from the TDS student discussion forum and shows an automated email received by a student detailing the results of Project 1 prerequisite checks. The email states that the student's GitHub repository and Docker image are publicly accessible and the MIT License is present, but that the Dockerfile is not found in the root of the GitHub repository, which is a failure. The email also explains that a valid Dockerfile and a publicly accessible Docker image are required. The student's overall prerequisites have failed resulting in a Project 1 score of 0, indicating they must resolve the Dockerfile issue to have their submission evaluated. It lists the steps including the podman command used during the automated check. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by karthiksirimilla]** This image depicts an email received by a student regarding their Project 1 prerequisites in a TDS course. The email outlines the requirements for Project 1, including having a publicly accessible GitHub repository with a LICENSE file and a valid Dockerfile, and ensuring the Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via a specified podman command, specifically: `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`. The email reports that the student's Docker image is present in Docker Hub and public, and the GitHub repo is present and public; however, it indicates a failure because the "Dockerfile present in root of github repo" check failed, and therefore the overall prerequisites check failed resulting in a project score of 0. This shows the student received automated feedback after submitting their project for evaluation. 2x" data-dominant-color="2F3033">IMG_64171290Ã—2796 305 KB
