**Q1: In this GA4 session, what's new compared to previous GAs?**

**A1:** The trajectory has moved from hard to easy. This GA is much easier and lighter than previous ones.

**Q2: How do I extract a table from HTML using Google Sheets?**

**A2:** This functionality is available in Google Sheets but not in Excel (unless you use plugins). The `IMPORTHTML` function will give you a #NAME? error in Excel.

**Q3: How can I extract data from the ODI Batsman Stats webpage?**

**A3:** I'll show you how to extract data from a different webpage, but you can find a similar example in my previous live session on YouTube.

**Q4: What do the parameters in the `IMPORTHTML` function mean?**

**A4:** The four parameters are: URL, query (either "list" or "table"), index (table number), and locale. The index is zero-based (like Python).
