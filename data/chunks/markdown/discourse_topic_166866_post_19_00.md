-Yes sir this project 1 is very tough for even 1 question a whole day is used.

@carlton @s.anand Sir besides this project we have other subject graded assignments and MLP Project and MAD2 project.

Please sir it would be very beneficial for everyone, we have talked to other students also we are not able to even complete the 10 A tasks even with the evaluate.py rest aside Task B.

Please sir take this into consideration. We are trying very hard for this project even you can see students asking various questions in the discourse, we are struggling but still sir we are trying.
