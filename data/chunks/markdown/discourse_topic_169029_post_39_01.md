**[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** This image depicts a student's interaction with the TDS solver API using a `curl` command in the command prompt, likely showing a peer discussion post where the student is testing the API endpoint. The command `curl -X POST "https://yantravid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects-5400c012.vercel.app/api/" -F "question=what is 2+2?"` sends a POST request to the specified URL with the question "what is 2+2?". The API responds with the JSON payload `{"answer":"4"}`, which is the expected answer. The command prompt shows the current directory as `D:\Yantravid>`. This suggests a successful API call demonstrating the basic functionality of the question-answering system and can be used to verify correct setup.travid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects-5400c012.vercel.app/api/`. The request includes the question "What is 2+2?" passed using the `-F` flag, which likely sends it as form data. The server responds with the JSON payload `{"answer":"4"}`, indicating a successful calculation. The presence of the command prompt `D:\Yantravid>` confirms the context is a local development environment. This demonstrates successful client-server communication, suggesting the student is testing the API endpoint of their TDS solver." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="8rzOP58fE4qRzWGIBZNIn0kYP7c" width="690" height="47" data-dominant-color="2E323A">
