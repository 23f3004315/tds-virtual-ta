There’s a lot of philosophy in there but that’s what makes it so entertaining to read his writing

if the entire grading bell curve has shifted

Disagree with this if you mean the bell curve has shifted between terms. RoE has been really tough since the past 3 terms at least (I haven’t checked with students who did it before that, so I don’t know about those). Or if the issue is a bell curve mismatch between different subjects, we shouldn’t be expecting that to be perfect. Some of the subjects were extremely easy, but nobody complained about those

For what it’s worth, I also felt it was tough beyond reason. These sort of exams where the time required far exceeds the time given is more typical of competitive exams where the score isn’t important, only your rank is. All that being said, I still didn’t complain since the difficulty is “real”, and not made-up like with BDM theory/project. With the first, the difficulty comes from an extremely poor grading system, and with the second, from having to find a business that will share data. The subjects themselves don’t pose a significant intellectual challenge.
