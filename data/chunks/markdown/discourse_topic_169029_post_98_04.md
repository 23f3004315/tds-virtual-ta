 between 3 and 5. I am scraping the correct movie names(for example 6th movie in given image), but the portal is accepting them differently. All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages—Spanish, Dutch, I believe.

**[Discussion Image by lakshaygarg654]** This image captures a student's interaction with a TDS solver tool, specifically concerning Project 2. The student provides JSON data containing movie information including the title "6. Nadaaniyan", year "2025", and rating "3.0". However, the tool flags an error: "Error: At [S]title: Values don't match. Expected: '6. Nadaaniyan', Actual: '6. Nadanian'". The error message suggests a discrepancy in the expected and actual movie titles, potentially due to regional differences in IMDb data or periodic data changes, and encourages manual title translation or re-running the scraper code. The student is likely troubleshooting why the tool isn't recognizing the movie title as expected based on the provided JSON.y translate titles. Results may also change periodically. You may need to re-run your scraper code.", which suggests potential issues with regional differences in IMDb data and the need for either manual title translation or re-running the scraper code to get the updated data." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="s9GyFRXUbn7HQ5BvJkRzRozInGr" width="517" height="129" srcset="**[Discussion Image by lakshaygarg654]** This image captures a student's question regarding JSON data validation within the "Project 2 - TDS Solver" discussion. The student inputs JSON data containing information about a movie with fields like "id," "title," "year," and "rating" into a system, presumably for checking against expected values. An error message "Error: At [5]title: Values don't match. Expected: '6. Naadaniyaan'. Actual: '6. Nadanian'" appears, indicating a discrepancy between the expected movie title and the actual title in the JSON data. A note below the error informs the student that IMDb search results can vary by region, manual translation of titles may be necessary, and that scraper code may need to be re-run due to periodic changes, suggesting potential solutions to the validation error. The student likely needs to either adjust the JSON data to match the expected title, or potentially re-scrape the data if the IMDb results have changed, as advised by the message displayed., **[Discussion Image by lakshaygarg654]** This image shows a student encountering an error while submitting JSON data to the TDS solver, specifically regarding the title field. The student input JSON includes "id": "tt30422937", "title": "6. Nadaaniyan", "year": "2025", and "rating": "3.0". The solver throws an error: "Error: At [5].title: Values don't match. Expected: "6. Naadaniyaan". Actual: "6. Nadaaniyan"", indicating a mismatch in the expected and actual title. The message also suggests that IMDb search results can vary by region, potentially necessitating manual translation of titles and periodic re-running of the scraper code. The presence of a "Check" button at the bottom implies that the student is attempting to validate or submit their solution. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by lakshaygarg654]** This image captures a student question within the TDS Solver Project 2 discussion thread. The student is inquiring about the JSON data, showing a sample JSON structure with fields like "id", "title", "year", and "rating". An error message is displayed, indicating a mismatch in the "title" field: "Error: At [5].title: Values don't match. Expected: '6. Naadaniyaan'. Actual: '6. Nadaaniyan'". The instructor provides guidance noting that IMDb search results can vary by region and may require manual translation of titles, suggesting also to re-run the scraper code due to periodic changes in results. The image shows a troubleshooting scenario related to data discrepancies when scraping information from IMDb, highlighting potential regional differences and data updates. 2x" data-dominant-color="F8F7FA">image1674×420 24.3 KB
