**[Discussion Image by shubhamatkal]** This image is part of a peer discussion in the TDS student forum, showing output related to Project 1. The output indicates the successful completion of task B1 ("B1 PASSED"). It also shows the task "Delete /data/format.md" is running, evidenced by the yellow circle, and an HTTP POST request is made to the localhost server at port 8325 with a task parameter to delete the "data/format.md" file. The HTTP response code "200 OK" suggests that the deletion request was successfully processed by the server. Students facing similar issues can use this as a reference to confirm successful HTTP operations and task completion.med by the system based on the given HTTP request and response." alt="b1passed" data-base62-sha1="bVPNsc87d4pYQAMPAvhdt6ls7Ti" width="690" height="87" srcset="**[Discussion Image by shubhamatkal]** This image shows the output from a student's local testing environment during the "TDS-official-Project1" assignment. Specifically, it illustrates the successful completion of test B1 ("B1 PASSED"). It also displays the process of "Running task: Delete /data/format.md" and the corresponding HTTP POST request made to the local server at `http://localhost:8325/run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md`, indicating that the task to delete the `format.md` file within the `data` directory was executed. The server responded with an "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" status, implying the deletion was successful. This feedback gives the student confirmation of their implementation so far and where to move forward., **[Discussion Image by shubhamatkal]** This image depicts a log output showing the execution of a task in the TDS project environment, indicating a student is likely testing their code and debugging issues. The output shows that test "B1" has passed, followed by the system attempting to delete the file `/data/format.md`. An HTTP POST request is then made to `http://localhost:8325/run` with the task specified as `Delete /data/format.md`, receiving an "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" response, implying a successful operation. The "Running task" message suggests the system is still processing and the student is awaiting the task completion, therefore this is a checkpoint to report task execution state. This level of detail helps students confirm proper task execution and troubleshoot if failures occur. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by shubhamatkal]** This image shows the output from a task running during the TDS project, indicating a peer discussion around task debugging. Specifically, the output shows "B1 PASSED", a yellow circle indicating a task in progress, and then a log line that reads "Running task: Delete /data/format.md". Following this is an HTTP request logged as "POST http://localhost:8325/run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"". This demonstrates the system is attempting to delete the specified file via an HTTP request to a local server on port 8325. The student is likely sharing this output to understand why a deletion task is running or to troubleshoot a possible issue given the context of the TDS project. 2x" data-dominant-color="FAFAFA">b1passed1109Ã—141 12.2 KB
