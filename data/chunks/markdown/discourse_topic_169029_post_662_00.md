**Subject:** Clarification Regarding Project 2 Reevaluation

Hi Team,

I received an email yesterday stating that our Project 2 would be reevaluated between 11 PM and 2 AM tonight.

However, I havenâ€™t seen any deployment logs on Railway during that timeframe, and my score on the dashboard is still showing as 0.

My url is working perfectly still there is no logs in the railway.

Could you please confirm whether my Project 2 was actually reevaluated?

Thank you!
