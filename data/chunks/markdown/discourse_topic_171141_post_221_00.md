Thanks @carlton , for your response.

I was never worried about the result, whether it comes late or early. I know you will release it once everything is processed correctly. My concern was only about getting a response. Anyway, thanks for replying.

Also, todayâ€™s session has been canceled. I wanted to ask about the issue with editing responses in the Project 2 form. Is there any update on this?
