## Narratives with Quill on Tableau

-[**[Course Image: Narratives with Quill on Tableau]** This image demonstrates creating a basic bar chart in Tableau to visualize the "Stringency Index" across different locations. The "Location" dimension is placed in the Columns shelf, while the "SUM(Stringency Index)" measure is placed in the Rows shelf. This configuration generates a bar chart where each bar represents a location, and the height of the bar corresponds to the sum of the Stringency Index for that location. The "Show Me" panel on the right provides alternative chart type suggestions based on the data. Understanding this setup is essential for visualizing geographical data and trends within Tableau projects. based on the Tableau image for RAG training:

This image demonstrates how to create a bar chart in Tableau showing the "Stringency Index" for different "Location" values. The "Location" dimension is placed on the Columns shelf, while the aggregate measure "SUM(Stringency Index)" is placed on the Rows shelf, automatically generating a bar chart that visualizes the stringency index for each location. This visualization allows for comparison of the stringency index across different locations. Using Tableau's drag-and-drop interface, you can quickly create insightful visualizations from your data, which can be crucial for archiving data and using it for comparison purposes. When working with this kind of visualization in Tableau, make sure the data types are correctly assigned for accurate analysis; location should be a dimension, and the stringency index should be a measure.)](https://youtu.be/b_Qojb9gLzA)
