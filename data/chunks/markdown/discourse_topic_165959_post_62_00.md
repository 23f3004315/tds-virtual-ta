In ques 4 Scrap the BBC Weather API,

I scraped the locationId for my city (i.e Mumbai)

and post that also mapped each `issueDate` to its corresponding `enhancedWeatherDescription` .

The sample output mentioned was:

The output would look like this:

`{
 "2025-01-01": "Sunny with scattered clouds",
 "2025-01-02": "Partly cloudy with a chance of rain",
 "2025-01-03": "Overcast skies",
 // ... additional days
}
`
And My Output after scraping (And as explained by professor in Video 2 BBC weather was)

{

“2025-02-05”: “A clear sky and light winds”,

“2025-02-06”: “A clear sky and light winds”,

“2025-02-07”: “A clear sky and light winds”,

“2025-02-08”: “A clear sky and light winds”,

“2025-02-09”: “A clear sky and light winds”,
