**[Discussion Image by 24ds2000125]** This image captures a student's attempt to define the API URL endpoint, "http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute", during a TDS exercise in January 2025, which resulted in a SyntaxError. The error message "SyntaxError: 'undefined' is not valid JSON" suggests an issue with the expected data format. The system checks the endpoint by sending a GET request with a task, encoded in the URL parameter '?q=...', and verifies if the response matches expectations, emphasizing the importance of argument order. The context shows an attempt to validate user input against the expected API endpoint format.y confused as to why the base URL causes a JSON error. The lack of query parameters or an actual JSON response from that base URL is the cause." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-04 at 19.32.21" data-base62-sha1="yKA26eHp4zrHJiHgPkFxwK3zuB4" width="690" height="124" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 24ds2000125]** This image shows a student answering a question about the API URL endpoint for their LLM implementation, which the system then attempts to validate. The student input the URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`, but received an error message: `SyntaxError: "undefined" is not valid JSON`. This suggests the API is either not returning a JSON response or is returning a response with undefined values where JSON expects proper datatypes. The system clarifies that it will send a GET request to the provided URL with a query parameter `q` containing a task and that arguments in the request must match the function definition's order., **[Discussion Image by 24ds2000125]** This image captures a student's attempt to provide the API URL endpoint for their implementation in a TDS course exercise, specifically within the "GA3 - Large Language Models - Discussion Thread". The prompt asks "What is the API URL endpoint for your implementation? It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute". The student enters "http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute" into the provided input field. However, the system returns a "SyntaxError: 'undefined' is not valid JSON" error message, indicating that the provided URL, by itself, doesn't satisfy the expected JSON format the system is looking for, and will check it with a GET request using `?q=...` to verify that the correct response is returned. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 24ds2000125]** This image depicts a student attempting to input the API URL endpoint into a form field, likely for a task within the GA3 Large Language Models discussion thread. The student inputs "http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute," but the system returns a "SyntaxError: 'undefined' is not valid JSON" message, indicating an issue with the expected data format or server response from that URL. The system then provides context that it will check the URL by sending a GET request with a query parameter "q" containing a task and verifies that the response matches expectations and arguments are in the defined order. This indicates the system expects a JSON response to its GET request. The "Check" button suggests the student should then submit the corrected URL. 2x" data-dominant-color="F8F6F7">Screenshot 2025-02-04 at 19.32.212700Ã—488 55.4 KB
