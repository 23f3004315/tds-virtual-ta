`, ``, `` (with charset and viewport meta tags, and title "Dolphin Facts"), and a `` block defining body styles, indicating that the student is probably trying to access the webpage content but receiving the HTML source code instead. The error suggests a mismatch between the expected content based on the request and the actual HTML being served, possibly indicating an issue with GitHub Pages configuration or deployment process." data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/yzkzffKPrDxvLKTc2cwCglLYUy2.png?dl=1" title="Screenshot 2025-01-12 223630" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">**[Discussion Image by 22f3001315]** This image shows a student question and associated error message in the TDS "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion forum. The student, 22f3001315, asks "What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/". Below the input box is an error message: "Error: 22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in is not in the response: Dolphin Facts body {font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: #e0f7fa; color: #333; text-align:". This indicates that the system tried to fetch content using the student's email and received HTML content back, implying a potential misunderstanding of how the GitHub Pages URL is formed. The error also suggests an automated validation process that is failing because the input doesn't resolve to the expected URL/resource.L based on the student's account details but failing to find a match within the expected HTML response. The error likely occurs because the student is directly inputting their email into a field or system expecting a specific project or user-related URL." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-12 223630" data-base62-sha1="yzkzffKPrDxvLKTc2cwCglLYUy2" width="690" height="77" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f3001315]** This image captures a student question in the TDS "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion thread about the structure of a GitHub Pages URL, showing the example `https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`. An error message is displayed below the input field, indicating that the user `22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` is "not in the response". The response includes HTML content, starting with ``, suggesting the system is attempting to interpret HTML code as the student's user ID which is causing the error. This suggests the student may be mistakenly entering their email or some other identifier into a field meant for a GitHub username or repository name. The student's confusion stems from incorrectly entering their email address, or other invalid identifier, in a field expecting GitHub username or repo name, leading to the system interpreting the HTML in the response as part of the input and triggering an error., **[Discussion Image by 22f3001315]** This is a student question in the TDS "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion thread, specifically concerning GitHub Pages URLs. The student asks "What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/". Below the input area, there is an error message stating that the student's IITM email address (22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) is not in the response. The response it is receiving starts with "" and contains standard HTML tags like "", "", "", "Dolphin Facts", and some CSS styling for the body. This error suggests a problem with the deployment or URL configuration, likely related to authentication or access permissions when trying to access the GitHub Pages site, as the content served is not what the student expected, and the system is detecting the student's email is absent from the HTML response. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f3001315]** This is a student question in the TDS discussion about Github Pages URLs, where the student (22f3001315) asks what the GitHub Pages URL might look like, with an example URL provided as `https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`.
