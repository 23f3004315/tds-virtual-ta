## Types of datasets

[**[Course Image: Types of datasets]** This image is part of the TDS course material on "archive", specifically focusing on the types of datasets encountered when working with data archives. The image outlines three primary categories of datasets: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured, representing different levels of organization and complexity. Structured datasets, such as those found in databases, are highly organized with predefined schemas, making them easily searchable and analyzable. Understanding these dataset types is crucial for effectively managing, archiving, and retrieving data in various data science projects. This knowledge informs how data is stored, accessed, and ultimately used to derive insights.cation of datasets into three fundamental types: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Structured datasets, often found in databases, are organized in a predefined format with rows and columns. Semi-structured data doesn't conform to a rigid tabular format but has some organizational properties like tags or markers, and unstructured data lacks a specific format, such as text documents or images. Understanding these distinctions is crucial when archiving data, as the method of storage, retrieval, and analysis will vary depending on the dataset type. Recognizing the type of dataset ensures proper data handling practices within the archive.)](https://youtu.be/u8PIxqsi1kk)

- Structured data has a schema: Databases, Spreadsheets, Forms, Shapefiles
- Semi-structured data has a flexible schema: JSON, HTML, Email
- Unstructured data has no schema: Text, Images, Audio, Video
