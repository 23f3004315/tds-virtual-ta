**[Discussion Image by sarvan108]** This image shows a command-line terminal within a student discussion on development tools, specifically Prettier. The student, sarvan108, executing the command `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum` in the `~/downloads` directory. This command uses `npx` to run Prettier version 3.4.2 on the `README.md` file, piping the output to `sha256sum` to generate a SHA256 hash of the formatted output. The output shows the generated SHA256 checksum `2ccd877ded5f031c251d3319bc1b266018635156db88e63105943dbef7e106a1`. The post appears to be sharing the successful execution and result of using Prettier to format the `README.md` file and then calculating its SHA256 hash.-y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum` in the `~/downloads` directory. This command uses `npx` to run the `prettier` tool (version 3.4.2) on the `README.md` file and then pipes the output to the `sha256sum` command, which calculates the SHA256 hash of the formatted file content. The resulting SHA256 hash, `2ccd877ded5f031c251d3319bc1b266018635156db88e63105943dbef7e106a1 *-`, is then printed to the terminal. This indicates the student is likely verifying the contents or a specific version of the file after formatting with Prettier." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="1MZxB5Lh4rmhGVJ1UKWvK7VpkO4" width="690" height="77" data-dominant-color="10100F">
