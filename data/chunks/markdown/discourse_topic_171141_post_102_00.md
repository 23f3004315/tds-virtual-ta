## Post #102 by Pritul_raut

I realized that I made a mistake in my project by forgetting to uncomment a single line of code: os.path.join(os.getcwd(), “path_given”). I feel really bad about this oversight, especially after working so hard on the project and formatting everything carefully. It was an honest mistake, and I take full responsibility for it.

I sincerely request you to consider re-evaluating my work, as I believe it reflects the effort and dedication I put into it. I truly regret this error and will be more careful in the Project 2
