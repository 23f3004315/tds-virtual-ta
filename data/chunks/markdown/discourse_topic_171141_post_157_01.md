**[Discussion Image by 23f2005702]** This image shows an instructor's instructions for a student on a project, specifically addressing discrepancies. The instructions include how to count rows with SQL using curl, providing a specific command: `bash curl "http://localhost:8001/ticket-sales.csv?sql=SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE type=%22Bronze%22" -o /data/b10.csv`. The instructions also detail how to stop the Datasette server, either by bringing the server process to the foreground with `fg` or killing the process using `kill $(jobs -p)`. The summary of commands includes starting the server with `bash uvx datasette /data/ticket-sales.db --port 8001 &` and the curl command from above. The student is receiving an error: "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found" when trying to read `/data/b10.csv`, indicating that the file is not found, leading to a "B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv" error, resulting in a score of 10/20. The instructor's notes emphasize ensuring `uvx` and `datasette` are installed and configured correctly, and that the `/data` directory is writable.g the datasette server with `datasette /data/ticket-sales.db --port 8001`, as well as a reminder to ensure `uvx` and `datasette` are properly installed and configured, and that the `/data` directory is writable. At the end of the post, the error messages `HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found`, and `B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv` and student score indicate a failure to retrieve the b10 data." alt="Screenshot_2025-04-01-08-51-03-781_com.google.android.apps.docs" data-base62-sha1="rt4RWLXkL84tt2DQxU3WClYumFi" width="230" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2005702]** This image shows instructor guidance within the "Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies" discussion, specifically addressing Step 2 (counting rows with SQL) and Step 3 (stopping the Datasette server).

It details the instructions for starting the server, making a curl request to a specified URL (`http://localhost:8001/ticket-sales.csv`), and saving the output to `/data/b10.csv`. An error message "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found" and "B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv" indicates that the `curl` request failed, likely because the file `/data/b10.csv` was not found at the specified path, or there was a directory permissions issue.
