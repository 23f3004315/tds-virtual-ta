Please check the issue in the images provided. How to handle this question.

In **GA4 Q10**, very few students were able to solve the question using LLMs or Python during the assignment. Most of us ended up solving it manually. At that time, @carlton sir had mentioned that the question would be revised.

Here is the thread link for reference.

How should we handle this question now?

Thankyou
