**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image depicts a student encountering an error while building a Docker image in the TDS project, likely during a step to verify `uv` installation. The terminal output shows a series of commands executed during the `docker build` process, which includes updating the package list, installing `curl` and `ca-certificates`, and then using `curl` to download and execute the `uv` installation script. The build fails at step 4/7, specifically when executing the command `uv --version`, resulting in the error message "/bin/sh: 1: uv: not found". The Dockerfile snippet shows that this command is intended to verify the `uv` installation after the installation script is executed, suggesting that the installation either failed silently or didn't properly add `uv` to the system's PATH. The root cause appears to be that the `uv` command is not found after its intended installation within the Docker image build process, leading to the build failure and exit code 127.ile snippet shows the command intended to verify the `uv` installation, and the error reveals the installation either failed or requires PATH adjustment. The error at the bottom states "process "/bin/sh -c uv --version" did not complete successfully: exit code: 127", further confirming the `uv` command execution failure." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="r1GvMyIqZObTda5HTCebIAACpSs" width="690" height="387" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image shows a student encountering an error while building a Docker image for a TDS project. The student is following the project setup instructions within a Dockerfile, specifically trying to install and verify the "uv" tool. The `docker build` command fails at step 4/7, "RUN uv --version", with the error message "/bin/sh: 1: uv: not found", indicating that the 'uv' command is not recognized within the Docker container's shell after the installation script ran in the previous step. This suggests that the installation script might not be correctly setting up the PATH or creating a symbolic link to the 'uv' executable, which the Dockerfile attempts to verify at line 25 via `RUN uv --version`. The core issue appears to be a failed installation or incorrect PATH configuration for the 'uv' tool inside the Docker image., **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image shows a student's terminal during a Docker build process, revealing a problem during the installation and verification of the `uv` package. The student navigated to the project directory and executed `docker build -t 22f3002723:latest .`, initiating the build based on the Dockerfile. The build process proceeds until it reaches a step to verify the `uv` installation using `uv --version`, which fails with the error message "/bin/sh: 1: uv: not found", indicating that the `uv` executable is not found in the container's PATH. The Dockerfile excerpt shows the line `RUN uv --version`, which is intended to check the installed version of `uv`. The final error message indicates that the Docker build process failed because the command `uv --version` returned a non-zero exit code (127). This implies the `uv` installation in the previous step may have failed or the PATH was not correctly configured. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image depicts a student encountering an error while building a Docker image for the TDS Project 1. The Dockerfile attempts to verify the `uv` installation by running `uv --version`, but this command fails with the error "/bin/sh: 1: uv: not found," indicating that the `uv` executable is not available in the Docker image's PATH at that stage of the build process. The preceding steps in the Dockerfile likely install `uv`, and the error suggests that it's not being found due to PATH issues or incorrect installation. The error message also indicates that the `docker build` process failed with exit code 127. The student is attempting to resolve an error in the Dockerfile that prevents successful image creation. The Dockerfile lines 24-25 shows "# Verify uv installation" and ">>> RUN uv --version". 2x" data-dominant-color="141619">image1919Ã—1079 301 KB
