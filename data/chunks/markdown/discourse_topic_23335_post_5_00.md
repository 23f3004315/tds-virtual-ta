I am totally clue less about the expectation of instructor from the participants of this course. And the question of graded assignment was something, I found myself out of context. I know I can pass any course but I donâ€™t just wanna pass without any concrete learning. The real problem this time is not TIME.

Hopefully courses instructor will guide us through this conundrum.
