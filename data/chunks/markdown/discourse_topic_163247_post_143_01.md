**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image shows a bar graph of the GA3 Active Score Distribution, indicating a peer discussion where a student is sharing assessment results. The x-axis represents scores in ranges of 10 (e.g., 0-10, 10-20), while the y-axis represents the count of GA3 students. The chart reveals the number of students achieving scores within each range, such as 12 students in the 0-10 range, 42 in the 10-20 range, and a peak of 249 students in the 90-100 range. These visual representations helps students understand their performance relative to their peers and could spark discussion on study strategies or areas for improvement. The score distribution may also highlight areas where students collectively struggled, potentially prompting course adjustments.the range (80, 90] has a low student count of 35." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 8.11.15 pm" data-base62-sha1="91Xm1fbCPgevzTTdS4aHKLZF5ZI" width="690" height="279" srcset="**[Discussion Image by carlton]** The image is a bar chart titled "GA3 Active Score Distribution" showing the distribution of GA3 student scores, displayed as "GA3 Student Count" on the y-axis against score ranges on the x-axis. The score ranges are in increments of 10, from "0" to "(90, 100]". The bar chart visually represents the number of students falling into each score range, with the highest bar being in the (90, 100] range with a student count of 249. Other bars include (0,10] with 42 students, (10,20] with 49 students, (20,30] with 62 students, (30,40] with 55 students, (40,50] with 59 students, (50,60] with 93 students, (60,70] with 104 students, (70,80] with 91 students, (80,90] with 35 students, and the low value of 12 for score 0. This provides a visual representation of student performance on GA3, highlighting score concentration., **[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image from a TDS student discussion thread titled "GA3 - Large Language Models - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]" depicts a histogram showing the distribution of GA3 active scores. The x-axis represents score ranges in increments of 10 (e.g., 0, (0,10], (10,20], up to (90,100]), while the y-axis shows the count of GA3 students in each range. Most students scored high, with 249 students falling into the (90, 100] range. The plot allows students to visually assess the overall class performance on the GA3 assignment related to large language models, indicating a high-scoring cohort. This is likely shared for comparison and understanding of student achievement in the course. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image from a student discussion thread shows a visualization of GA3 (Generative AI Assignment 3) active score distribution. It's a bar chart depicting the student count for different score ranges. The x-axis represents score ranges, such as 0, (0, 10], (10, 20], up to (90, 100], while the y-axis indicates the number of students. For instance, the bar for the (90, 100] range shows the highest student count, specifically 249, as indicated by the popup when hovering over the bar. This distribution likely sparked discussion among students, and the visualization helps to identify score clusters and potentially address areas where students performed well or struggled. 2x" data-dominant-color="E6EDFB">Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 8.11.15 pm3444Ã—1394 188 KB
