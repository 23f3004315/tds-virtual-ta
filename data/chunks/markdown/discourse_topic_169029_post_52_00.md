They(instructors) only donâ€™t what to do it looks like, Anand Sir will tell them and they will tell you (with 25-50 percent lossy communication), just wait and keeping tagging Anand Sir. He will explain clearly, Ask everyone to push for a live session with Anand Sir , that 40 mins he explains will be worth its weight in gold, Hope he does that.
