@carlton Will there be evaluation script for tasks in group B also?

Some questions about ‘B’ group tasks:

Q1: For the following tasks (B5, B7, B9, and B10) tasks, how will input files be provided? Will it be URL or will `datagen.py` also generate files for these?

Q2: For the above tasks as well as for B6 ( Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website), how should output be returned?

Q3: In task B8, for transcribing audio file, which Python package is recommended or do we need to use OpenAI API?

B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database

B7. Compress or resize an image

B8. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file

B9. Convert Markdown to HTML

B10. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data
