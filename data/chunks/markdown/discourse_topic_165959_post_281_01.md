**[Discussion Image by 21f3000745]** This image depicts a student's attempt to define a JSON structure representing the weather forecast for Vienna. The student has provided a JSON object where keys are dates (e.g., "2025-02-10") and values are weather descriptions (e.g., "Sunny and a gentle breeze"). An error message "Error: At root: Different number of properties" appears, indicating a problem with the JSON's structure, even though on the surface, it appears correctly formatted as a key-value pair object. This might indicate a misunderstanding of JSON formatting requirements or a validation issue specific to the tool/environment the student is using; the error is likely due to an assumption that a single JSON property can contain multiple key-value pairs, where each date-forecast pair is seen as a separate root property. The student is likely seeking clarification on correctly structuring JSON data for weather forecasts and troubleshooting this error.ntaining weather forecasts for dates ranging from "2025-02-10" to "2025-02-14", each with a corresponding weather description (e.g., "Sunny and a gentle breeze"). An error message is displayed below the JSON: "Error: At root: Different number of properties," which likely indicates a validation issue with the provided JSON data, possibly due to unexpected formatting, schema differences, or the tool used for validation expects a different data structure. The error suggests the JSON format might not be valid based on the application's expected schema or the JSON parser's requirements." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="z1stEGA0d7y0K8cdoELFf3CGC54" width="606" height="293">image606Ã—293 20.3 KB
