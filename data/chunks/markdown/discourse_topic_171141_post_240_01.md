 git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0

@carlton Sir please look into this.

**[Discussion Image by Vedant22]** This image displays the prerequisite evaluation results for Project 1 in a student discussion forum. The evaluation criteria include checking if the Docker image is present and public on Docker Hub, and if the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license are present and public in the GitHub repository's root. The evaluation output shows that the Docker image failed the presence and public access check, while the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license passed. As a result, the overall prerequisites are marked as FAIL, and the Project 1 Score is 0, preventing further evaluation. The image also includes a podman command for running the Docker image and emphasizes the requirement of using the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository.an run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` to run the Docker container and emphasizes that the Docker image used must utilize the same Dockerfile as the one in the GitHub repository." alt="IMG_7078" data-base62-sha1="9cVv4NyVXvwIVWEBlYSIuNPvtiN" width="394" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Vedant22]** This image shows a snippet from an evaluation report of a student's Project 1 submission in a TDS course, likely an instructor providing feedback. The evaluation checks for several prerequisites, including whether the Docker image is present in Docker Hub and is public (FAIL), whether the GitHub repository is present and public (PASS), and whether a Dockerfile and MIT license are present in the root of the GitHub repository (both PASS). The overall prerequisite check failed, resulting in a Project 1 score of 0, and emphasizes that the submission won't be evaluated if minimum requirements aren't met. The output also includes a command to run the docker image with `podman`: `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`., **[Discussion Image by Vedant22]** This image shows feedback on a student's Project 1 submission, indicating a peer discussion context, specifically automated evaluation results. It details the prerequisites and their evaluation status, revealing that the "Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public" check failed, leading to an overall "Prerequisites: FAIL" status and a "Project 1 Score: 0." The message emphasizes the importance of the Docker image being both present and public on Docker Hub and also mentions the command to run the container locally using podman, including environment variable and port mapping. Finally, the feedback specifies the dockerfile must be the same as in the Github repo. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Vedant22]** This image shows automated feedback on a student's Project 1 submission, specifically the prerequisite evaluations. The system reports that the Docker image is NOT present in Docker Hub or is not public, resulting in a "FAIL" for that check, even though the GitHub repository is present and public, the Dockerfile is in the root, and the MIT license is also in the root of the repository, all resulting in a "PASS". Because the Docker image test failed, the overall prerequisites are marked as "FAIL," and the Project 1 score is set to "0." The snippet "podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME" suggests how the Docker image should be accessible. The note highlights that Docker image must use the same Dockerfile as the one in the Github Repository. 2x" data-dominant-color="333437">IMG_7078828×1049 164 KB
