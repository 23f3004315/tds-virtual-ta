**[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** This image captures a student (Algsoch) encountering import errors and dependency issues within a VS Code environment while working on the LLM-based Automation Agent project. The terminal shows a "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'" when running `main.py`, indicating that the FastAPI library is not installed or not accessible in the current environment. The student also attempts to upgrade pip using `pip install --upgrade python`, but receives an error stating "Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement python". The image shows the project structure with `main.py`, `app.py`, `Dockerfile`, and other related files, suggesting the student is configuring and testing the application, likely followed by a Docker build attempt. The ultimate confusion here is a basic python dependency and environment config problem and the image visually shows the student has not successfully resolved the issue. trying to resolve them through pip upgrades and Dockerization." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="tKDB9OvCsBntiPn9UaFPfgI5hQX" width="690" height="365" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** The image shows a student's (Algsoch) IDE, likely VS Code, with the `main.py` file open, and the terminal displaying error messages related to dependency management and docker build. The `main.py` file contains code that imports `FastAPI`, but the terminal shows a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'` traceback, indicating the FastAPI library isn't installed in the current environment. The terminal also shows attempts to upgrade pip and install "python", both resulting in errors related to versioning or missing distribution. Finally, the student attempts to build a Docker image named "llm-agent" using `docker build -t llm-agent`, and the build process appears to have started successfully. This is a student question because it displays the "fastapi" library wasn't installed in the current environment, which should be installed by the student., **[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** This image captures a student (Algsoch) facing issues while working on Project 1, specifically related to setting up the LLM-based Automation Agent. The student's code in `main.py` imports `FastAPI`, but the terminal shows a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`. The student attempted to upgrade `pip` and then tried to install "python" (incorrectly), which resulted in "ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement python". Finally, the student attempts a `docker build`, which takes considerable time. This indicates a dependency installation problem that prevents the FastAPI application from running locally or within the Docker build environment. The student needs to correctly install the `fastapi` package using pip to resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError`. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** This image captures a student's (Algsoch) post in the TDS "Project 1" discussion thread, specifically showcasing troubleshooting steps related to a "fastapi" import error. The student is encountering issues while building a Docker image and running the `main.py` script due to a "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'". Furthermore, the terminal output indicates that the student tried to upgrade Python using `pip install --upgrade python` but received an "ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement python" message, suggesting a misunderstanding of how `pip upgrade` is used (it should be used to upgrade packages, not the python interpreter itself). The screenshot displays the VS Code IDE, highlighting the `main.py` file where the `fastapi` import is located and the Dockerfile along with the build output in the terminal window. The output also shows a notification suggesting upgrading pip, although this is a separate concern from the primary FastAPI import error. 2x" data-dominant-color="202121">image1919Ã—1016 117 KB
