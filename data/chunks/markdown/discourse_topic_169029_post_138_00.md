## Post #138 by 22f3002933

Hello sir,

My question is, the questions my endpoint will be evaluated are they the exact same ones with same parameters for my respective email as on the assignment portal ?

Essentially I am trying to understand there are certain questions where I donâ€™t have to solve the question again and just return the hardcoded answers, would that be correct ?
