**[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image depicts a student's coding environment, specifically the `evaluate.py` file open within VS Code, likely part of a project related to TDS (The Data Science) course. The code starts with a script header indicating Python version 3.13 or higher and lists dependencies such as "faker," "httpx," "lxml," and others. It then imports various Python modules like `sys`, `hashlib`, `json`, and `numpy`, and imports several functions beginning with "get_" from a custom module named `datagen`. Finally the student has set their OpenAI and Gemini API keys in lines 38 and 39. This is likely a student question, as there may be errors related to dependencies or module imports.openai_api_key` and `gemini_api_key`, suggesting the code interacts with OpenAI and Gemini APIs, likely to evaluate or test LLM performance based on generated data. The student might be facing discrepancies or errors related to these modules or API configurations, prompting them to share this code in the discussion." alt="evalue" data-base62-sha1="gB0UNUrNZnqpMbje7Mt23Lft27w" width="378" height="499" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image depicts a code snippet from a student's VS Code environment during the TDS Project 1 discussion, specifically within the "evaluate.py" file located in the "llmagent" project folder. The code starts with comments indicating Python version requirement and dependencies ("faker", "httpx", "lxml", "numpy", "pillow", "python-dateutil"), followed by a series of standard library imports like `sys`, `hashlib`, `httpx`, `io`, `json`, `logging`, `numpy`, `os`, `random`, `re`, and `subprocess`. There are also imports from project-specific modules, such as functions like `get_markdown`, `get_dates`, etc., from the "datagen" module and `fromstring` from "lxml.html" along with `Image` from the "PIL" module. The "openai_api_key" and "gemini_api_key" variables are defined, with the OpenAI API key being partially visible, suggesting a configuration or credentials setup. The overall context suggests the student may be checking the dependencies and setup of the "evaluate.py" script, potentially debugging import errors or API key issues encountered during the project., **[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image depicts a student's code in VS Code, showcasing the `evaluate.py` file open within the `Ilmagent` directory. The code imports various Python libraries, including `sys`, `hashlib`, `httpx`, `io`, `json`, `logging`, `numpy`, `os`, `random`, `re`, `subprocess`, `dateutil.parser`, `lxml.html`, and `PIL`. Critically, it also imports several functions (e.g., `get_markdown`, `get_dates`, `get_contacts`) from a local module named `datagen`. The script also defines `openai_api_key` and `gemini_api_key`. The file `.env` is also open in the editor indicating the student is working with environment variables. The image likely represents a point of confusion for the student, as the context is a discussion about discrepancies in the project, and the code shown is central to the project's functionality. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image shows a snippet of the `evaluate.py` file within the `llmagent` project in a VS Code editor, alongside the `.env` file, suggesting a student is working on a coding assignment. The code begins with comments defining the script and its Python version/dependencies, then imports several standard Python libraries (sys, hashlib, etc.). It also imports custom functions like `get_markdown`, `get_dates`, etc. from a `datagen` module, as well as `fromstring` from `lxml.html`, and `Image` from `PIL`. Importantly, the code contains the `openai_api_key` and `gemini_api_key` variables, likely loaded from the `.env` file as a secured way to store API credentials. This is likely a student contribution, showing the structure and dependencies used to run the `evaluate.py` script. 2x" data-dominant-color="222323">evalue752Ã—994 45.3 KB
