**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image is part of a peer discussion on course access and video lectures, and shows general course information rather than a specific student question or technical issue. The information includes that the course exposes students to real-life tools and that it is quite hard, and emphasizes that programming skills are a prerequisite. Additionally, it states that the course encourages learning by sharing, suggesting a collaborative learning environment. Since the original post relates to access issues, this information likely serves as a general orientation or expectation-setting for students encountering difficulties. The image does not show any error messages, code, or specific troubleshooting, but it does highlight the expected difficulty and necessary skills to aid in problem-solving efforts.xposes students to real-life tools, is quite hard, and assumes prior programming skills. The announcement also encourages learning by sharing among the students. Although not directly related to the calendar/video access issue raised in the main thread title, this is likely shared to help students understand the nature and demands of the course. Students can use this information to gauge their readiness and adjust expectations accordingly." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-13 at 22.59.19" data-base62-sha1="yIY96OaJXJOdMbtHr9otjK1dfll" width="690" height="237" data-dominant-color="3E464C">Screenshot 2025-01-13 at 22.59.19778×268 22.7 KB
