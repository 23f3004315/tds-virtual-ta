 those specific tests/tasks. Finally, a note indicates that only students whose API service started within 5 minutes will receive an evaluation log in addition to the Docker log. 2x" data-dominant-color="F8F8F9">image1315×732 45.7 KB

MOST importantly mail shows :

**Your final t score** calculation is based on

MIN (20, (task score + bonus))

**Github repo submitted:** GitHub - 23f2001390/llmagent

**Docker repo submitted:** 23f2001390/llmagent

**Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)**

Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1

Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1

Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1

Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1

Your task score is: 0

Your bonus is: 1

Your P1 score is: 1

So according to the above, I passed the pre-requisites and also in mail u have mentioned that:

We have attached the docker logs and the evaluation logs for everyone who passed the pre-requisites.

but I don’t find my mail id or roll number in the docker_logs.zip or evaluation_logs.zip that has been given in the mail(latest), if I passed the pre requisites my logs should be there in the zip files included in this latest mail right, my roll number is 23f2001390 and email id is 23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
