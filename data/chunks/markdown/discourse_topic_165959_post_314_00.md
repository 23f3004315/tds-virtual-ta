## Post #314 by 24ds2000108

**Direct Link**: [Post #314](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/165959/314)

I am still not sure why the github action question is not working for me. I have manually triggered the workflow multiple times but i keep getting the same ‘name’ error even though it has been specified in the code. Can somebody kindly help?
