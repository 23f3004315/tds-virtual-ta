## Post #355 by carlton

The reason in the lecture they were using ./data was because they were debugging in their local machine not in the docker.

For the docker image (the official submission) you must use /data.

It is a clear requirement mentioned in the project page.

Thats why it works fine when you use it in the docker image.

Kind regards
