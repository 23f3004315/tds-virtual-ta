for question 4, i have tried `=forecast` and also `=forecast.ets`, both of them are not working. There are two columns for years. One is year of manufacturing, another is year of registration. which one to take.

for question 7, none of the options match. I am selecting the `MOST ACCURATE` among the given options. Hope, it is correct
