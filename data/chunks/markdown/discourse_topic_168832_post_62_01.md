**[Discussion Image by 23f2000599]** This image shows the output of a student's attempt to extract data from a PDF file using the `tabula-py` library in Python. The first part of the output lists the installed packages and their versions required by `tabula-py`, indicating the dependencies are met. After the file upload, the `q-extract-tables-from-pdf` (2).pdf file is processed, triggering warnings related to font fallback in the `tabula.backend` due to `stderr` output from `org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.font.PDType1Font`. Finally, the extracted table data is displayed, showing subjects (Maths, Physics, etc.) along with numerical data and a "Group" column, with the `dtype` of the data listed as 'object', and int64 where appropriate.ical values for 'Maths', 'Physics', 'English', 'Economics', 'Biology', and a 'Group' column. The student appears to be successful in extracting the table, although font rendering issues are noted." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="hzEXHUtuVLO27Dk4qWGd70DkoNm" width="690" height="291" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2000599]** This image depicts a student's interaction with the `tabula-py` library in a coding environment, likely related to a remote exam. The output shows that several dependencies required by `tabula-py`, such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `python-dateutil`, are already installed. The student has uploaded a PDF file named "q-extract-tables-from-pdf (2).pdf" and is saving extracted tables to a new PDF. Warnings related to `tabula.backend` indicate fallback fonts (LiberationSans and ZapfDingbats) are being used, suggesting potential font issues in the original PDF. The extracted table from the PDF showing numerical data for Maths, Physics, English, Economics, Biology, and Group is then displayed, with the data types of each column explicitly listed as `int64` (except 'dtype: object'), indicating a successful table extraction., **[Discussion Image by 23f2000599]** This image captures a segment of a student's debugging process while working with the `tabula-py` library in a Jupyter Notebook environment, focusing on extracting tables from a PDF document. The initial lines show successful installation/requirement satisfaction of `tabula-py` and its dependencies (`pandas`, `numpy`, etc.). Next, the student uploads a PDF named "q-extract-ta...m-pdf (2).pdf". Subsequently, the extracted table data is printed along with its datatypes and a few warning messages indicating fallback font usage during the PDF processing by the tabula backend. The warnings related to fallback fonts suggest the PDF may contain fonts not natively supported, but this does not appear to prevent the code from running and successfully extracting the table data. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2000599]** This image shows the output of a student's attempt to extract tables from a PDF document using the `tabula-py` library in a Python environment. It begins by showing the successful installation and dependency satisfaction for `tabula-py`, `pandas`, `numpy`, and other related packages. Next, the student uploads "q-extract-ta...m-pdf (2).pdf", and the system indicates that it is saving a derived file. Then, warning messages regarding fallback fonts ("LiberationSans" and "ZapfDingbats") are displayed, suggesting that the original fonts in the PDF are not available. Finally, the extracted table is printed, showing columns like Maths, Physics, English, Economics, Biology, and Group with integer values. The `dtype: object` suggests that the column types might need further processing. 2x" data-dominant-color="F5F5F5">image1604Ã—678 66.9 KB
