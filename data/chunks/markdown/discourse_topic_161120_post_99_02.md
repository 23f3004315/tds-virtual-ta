The student is instructed to download `Llamafile` and run the `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6 K.llamafile` model. The next step is to create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using `ngrok`. The student asks what the `ngrok` URL might look like, and a format example `https://[random].ngrok-free.app/` is given, but the student's actual generated `ngrok` URL `https://fd8c-2405-201-6808-a99e-871-6b1a-adb9-36c5.ngrok-free.app/` shows an error, likely indicating an issue with the tunnel creation or the URL itself. This suggests the student needs further troubleshooting guidance to resolve the `ngrok` setup for the `Llamafile` server. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f3002537]** This image depicts a student's question regarding the ngrok URL within a deployment tools discussion.
