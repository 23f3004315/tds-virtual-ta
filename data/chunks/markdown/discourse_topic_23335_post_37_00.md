In the orientation it was clearly stated that is no end term eligibility for this course and in the graded document it is stated that 5/8 and because of this i havent submitted earlier week assignments and now it is stated that only starting 5 are considered now i am ineligible for end term

please help me out in this

given that i have attempted and scored well in ROE and also submitted both the projects
