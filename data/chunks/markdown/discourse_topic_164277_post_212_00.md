@s.anand @carlton

While running the evaluation.py i am facing several issues because my output isnt strictly adhering sometimes to it will the checking be on such a basis only

for example in A3

EXPECTED:

129

RESULT:

“129”

this is the error i get while it is the function in eval.py checking problem as it gets response as text and doesnt strip (“”)

Please guide what should i do
