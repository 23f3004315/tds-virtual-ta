**[Discussion Image by 22f2001630]** This image shows a student's attempt to answer a question on the TDS GA3 assignment regarding Large Language Models, specifically about determining the API URL endpoint. The student enters "http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity" as their answer, but the system returns an error message: "Error: Got incorrect matches". The error message also includes a statement about customer feedback and infrastructure upgrades. The instructions highlight the importance of enabling CORS to allow OPTIONS and POST methods, implying the student needs to configure these aspects in their implementation to correctly answer the question, and notes that the system will check the URL with a POST request containing a JSON body.ion Calling with OpenAI"." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="oBremW6ExHDCPqKc0OjJ1DARs2V" width="690" height="388" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f2001630]** This image captures a student's attempt to answer a question on an online exam for the TDS course GA3 regarding Large Language Models. The question asks for the API URL endpoint, and the student has entered `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`. However, upon checking, an error message appears: "Error: Got incorrect matches." The error message notes that ease of use is a priority and mentions infrastructure upgrades and available documentation. The prompt also indicates the system will send a POST request to the URL with a JSON body. The page also mentions enabling CORS to allow OPTIONS and POST methods. The student's confusion stems from the error despite seemingly following the expected URL format based on the example provided., **[Discussion Image by 22f2001630]** This image captures a student's attempt to answer a question in the TDS Jan 2025 GA3 Large Language Models discussion. The student is asked to provide the API URL endpoint for their implementation, which is expected to resemble `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`. The student enters `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`, but receives the error "Got incorrect matches". The error message also includes a generic blurb about customer feedback and infrastructure upgrades, indicating the student's answer didn't produce the expected output when tested with a POST request containing random docs and a query. This is a clear point of confusion for the student, as the provided URL format appears correct, but fails the evaluation. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f2001630]** This image depicts a student taking an online exam or assessment related to Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically the "GA3 - Large Language Models" module in January 2025. The student is currently on question 8, which focuses on "Function Calling with OpenAI" and is worth 1.5 marks. The student has entered the API URL "http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity" but is receiving an "Error: Got incorrect matches" message. The instructions state that the system will check the implementation by sending a POST request with a JSON body containing random docs and query, and it emphasizes enabling CORS for OPTIONS and POST methods. The expected response format is also provided, showing the ordering of document contents based on similarity. The timer shows 7 hours, 38 minutes, and 35 seconds remaining and the student has 0/9.5 points and options to "Check all" and "Save" at the top of the screen. 2x" data-dominant-color="BDC8C7">image1920Ã—1080 252 KB
