## Post #105 by 22f2001640

Respected @s.anand @carlton and @Jivraj ,

Is anyone actively monitoring the Discourse page? I have been raising this issue for the past few days, but there has been no response. Does this mean the TAs are not addressing studentsâ€™ concerns?

I am encountering the following error while running my project with these LLM endpoints:

**https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions**
**https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings**
