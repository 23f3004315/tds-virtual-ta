Sir,

Earlier I received an email stating I need to turn on my server **again** , but I am afraid that I will not be able to do so as I have already travelling and will be travelling till 18th. I am sure you will understand my situation and therefore requesting to please help/suggest on way forward. Thanking in advance for your valuable help and support.

Kind Regards,

Anushka Kumar (22f2000559)
