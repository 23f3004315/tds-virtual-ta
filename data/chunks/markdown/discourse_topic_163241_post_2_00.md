@23f1002382 - The topics &amp; resources that might help prepare for the projects at https://tds.s-anand.net/. It’s an evolving site. We keep adding whatever’s required that’s (a) new or (b) unknown to some students.

Please go through the content. Where you find gaps, please let us know. If it’s a need across multiple students, we’ll find / create the content around it.

Looking forward to your project!
