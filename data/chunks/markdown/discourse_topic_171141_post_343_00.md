Hi, I work in the IT industry. There is no standard like “docker file has to be only in the root folder.”

If at all you are setting a requirement why was this not mentioned in the project page?

We were asked to build an app which solves the given tasks. You were OK for whatever code/tools/method to use as long as it works, there the “industry standard” didn’t show up ironically!!!

Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.

In the same industry that I work - we build the dockers and give it for prod push.
