Hi @carlton @Jivraj

Facing some issues in running my project. Taking an example of the Phase A - A3 task.

I am able to read my files through the GET/read/data/dates.txt query.

I am also able to use the count_wednesdays function through the POST/run task/count_wednesdays.

But when I am entering a query such as “count_wednesdays in data/dates.txt” I am unable to get a response.
