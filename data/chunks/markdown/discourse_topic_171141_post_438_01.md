**[Discussion Image by swatikap]** This image is a screenshot of the evaluation results for a student's Project 1 submission, likely presented within the course platform; it shows the automatic grading output, indicating potential areas of student confusion. The output shows the submitted Github and Docker repo URLs, followed by a "Pre-requisites check" section, where checks for repo existence, timestamp, LICENSE file and Dockerfile presence all passed (indicated by "1"). The bulk of the output is a grid of cells (A1-A10, B1-B10, C1-C5) containing 1s and 0s, apparently reflecting the outcome of test cases. At the bottom, the "task score" is 3, the "bonus" is 0, and the "P1 score" (likely the final score for Project 1) is 4, reflecting the calculation MIN (20, (task score + bonus)).inks, along with a breakdown of "pre-requisites checks" and a scoring matrix. The pre-requisite checks confirm the existence and public accessibility of the Docker and GitHub repos before a specific date (Feb 18th), and the presence of a LICENSE file and Dockerfile in the GitHub repository. A grid labeled A1-A10, B1-B10, and C1-C5 shows pass/fail (1/0) for various test cases or subtasks, resulting in a task score of 3, a bonus of 0, and a total P1 score of 4. The final score is capped at 20, derived from the task score and bonus. This is likely part of an instructor's response after a student submitted their project, providing feedback on automated grading results." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="nv2LBjsOTgW23fOi7uzcT0M7EJB" width="690" height="358" data-dominant-color="FAFAFA">image1310Ã—681 14.5 KB
