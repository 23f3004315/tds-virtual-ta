**[Discussion Image by 23f2000778]** This image shows part of an instructor-provided rubric outlining the prerequisites for a project, using a "1" to indicate a pass and "0" for a fail. The prerequisites listed include: the existence of a public Docker repository with a timestamp before February 18th, the existence of a public GitHub repository, the presence of a LICENSE or LICENSE.md file (with MIT License) in the GitHub repository, and the existence of a Dockerfile in the GitHub repository. Each requirement is marked with a "1", indicating that the student has successfully met these prerequisites. This information likely serves as a reference point for student self-assessment and instructor grading. The document functions as learning guidance, clarifying expected project components.ublic Docker repository and a public GitHub repository exist with timestamps before February 18th. It also checks for the existence of a LICENSE or LICENSE.md file (with an MIT License) and a Dockerfile in the GitHub repository. All prerequisites in the image show a "1", indicating they have been met. This is likely posted by a student checking if they have completed all the steps before submitting their project." alt="Screenshot 2025-04-06 202736" data-base62-sha1="zUXCv89JCNRQwOB0Ig4VD9EbO2F" width="662" height="141">Screenshot 2025-04-06 202736662Ã—141 5.41 KB
