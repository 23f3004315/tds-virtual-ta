Hey guys, thank you everyone for voicing out your opinions and perspective in a healthy manner. I really appreciate it. I understand it might start to sound like greek and latin for some of you, but we intentionally made the decision to have ML foundations as co-requisite. Because you can learn the theory and try to visit back and connect with the practice (tools) part. Some pointers which could be helpful for all of you having different perspectives (both positive and negative) -

What is the benefit of this course? - passing this course would definitely make you industry ready. And Anand S, who himself is a very accomplished Data Scientist wanted to give the real flavour of how you would be working in Industry (no spoon-feeding, but giving you directions). Most examinations will be open book, open internet or take home.

We will share all the resources (codes, excel, etc.). You can download those supplementary materials from the drive link in course contents page.

There will be youtube live sessions every week and the calendar will be shared soon. Please used these live sessions if you need more help or guidance.
