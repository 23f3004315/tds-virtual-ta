@ankit.jain – I’m the culprit behind this RoE structure. Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process.

**What does this RoE evaluate?** Implicit learning.

Implicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?”
Explicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?”

Some may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few seconds.

Some, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit learning. But it takes time.

Some, they just CAN’T find out. Maybe the terminology is unclear. Maybe their skill set is different.

The RoE evaluates how much of learning is implicit. (Projects test how much is explicit.)

**Can you answer 17 Q in 30 m?** Hopefully not.

I hope this is at the edge of the class’ competence. If multiple people answer all 17, I’ll suggest 20 Q in 30 m next time, or pick tougher questions.

(This sounds harsh. Over time, though, I’ve come to value frank feedback over polite encouragement.)

**What knowledge helps solve it this fast?** Practice.

3 strategies help.
