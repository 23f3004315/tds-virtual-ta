**[Discussion Image by 23f2000599]** This image shows a student's terminal output related to their TDS Solver project, specifically within the "Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread". It reveals a JSON response from an API call, which includes information about the function called ("solver_1") and its parameters. Key fields in the JSON output such as "prompt_tokens", "completion_tokens", "cost", and "costError" are visible. Critically, the error message "crypto.createHash is not a function" is displayed within the 'costError' field, suggesting a problem with the student's code involving cryptographic hashing functionality and likely a missing or misconfigured crypto library. The information displayed helps to debug and troubleshoot issues faced by the student during the project.cating a potential problem with the cryptographic function being used within the solver. The final lines show an INFO message confirming a successful HTTP POST request to the /api endpoint, along with the student's user and path context within the TDS project, allowing other students or instructors to know exactly the stage of testing the student is at." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="q0z2JSvPnAPg5QFLIQSMopQUqoX" width="690" height="105" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2000599]** This image depicts a student's terminal output during the "TDS Solver" project, specifically relating to discussion thread #372. The output shows data loaded from a cache, including information about a function named "solver_1" designed to provide output from VS Code based on a specific command. The output presents a JSON structure containing details about a chat completion using the 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18' model, including information about tool calls, token usage (prompt, completion, total tokens), and cost metrics. Critically, it indicates a 'costError' of "crypto.createHash is not a function". The student has run the command "-s" via a POST request to the `/api` endpoint, which resulted in a 200 OK HTTP status. This output might show a part where the student is getting the response of the solver or trying to use specific commands., **[Discussion Image by 23f2000599]** This image shows the output of a student's attempt to run the TDS solver project, specifically related to Project 2. The output logs the embeddings loaded from the cache, followed by the structure of a function call to 'solver_1' which interacts with VS Code using a command. The logs also include the details of a chat completion object with the GPT-4o model, showing prompt and completion tokens used and a tool call with the command "-s" as argument. Crucially, the log reveals a "costError": 'crypto.createHash is not a function', indicating a problem with cryptographic hash creation during the TDS solver execution. Finally, the command line displays the successful POST request made to the API and the student's current working directory within the TDS project. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2000599]** This image shows a snippet of the debug output from the TDS solver project discussion thread, indicating a backend response and error message. The output shows 'Loaded embeddings from cache file' and subsequent numerical data, followed by JSON-formatted data representing the structure of the GPT function call, including function name 'solver_1', a description, parameters (command), and the command being executed '-s'. It details the chat completion object, model used, token usage, cost calculations, and reveals a 'costError': 'crypto.createHash is not a function'. Finally it displays an INFO line showing a successful HTTP POST request to the /api endpoint, concluding with the user's shell prompt. The student is facing an error related to the 'crypto.createHash' function, and this is likely a question for the instructor or peers about how to resolve this error in their implementation. 2x" data-dominant-color="1E1E1E">image1914×292 40.3 KB
