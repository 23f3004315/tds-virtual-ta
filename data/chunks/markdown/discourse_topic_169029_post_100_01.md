Hi @23f2003751

Short Answer: No
Long Answer:
Backslashes are usually not a problem when converting a string to JSON. But somehow the evaluation script isn’t taking this into consideration. Check this out.

This is my response

**[Discussion Image by Saransh_Saini]** This image depicts a snippet from the TDS Solver project discussion, specifically showcasing a validation check for the "Sorted JSON" output. The "Sorted JSON" displays an array of JSON objects, each representing a person's name and age. The data shown is: `[{ "name": "Bob", "age": 11 }, { "name": "Emma", "age": 11 }, { "name": "Grace", "age": 14 }, { "na`. At the end of the sorted JSON output, there's a checkmark icon followed by "Correct", indicating that the current sorting implementation is working as expected and validates the output of the TDS solver for the provided input. The image demonstrates successful handling or transformation of the JSON data within the project, as verified by the validation indicator. array of objects, each containing "name" and "age" key-value pairs, such as `{"name": "Bob", "age": 11}`. The provided example showcases several objects sorted in an undisclosed order, followed by an incomplete object `{"na` and a checkmark symbol, which implies that the student's sorting implementation is considered "Correct" up to that point. This suggests a step-by-step validation of the sorting logic and might reflect an instructor providing partial credit, or a student showcasing a working solution that needs further refinement. The presence of the "Correct" label also indicates a form of automated feedback or testing within the TDS Solver environment." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="6piS8L7Zr1ZlhHBJ2NHGPf7H0C7" width="690" height="77" data-dominant-color="262B2E">image1113×125 3.01 KB
