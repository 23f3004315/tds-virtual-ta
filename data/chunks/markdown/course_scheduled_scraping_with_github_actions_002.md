[**[Course Image: How to run Github Actions on a Schedule]** This image introduces the concept of scheduling GitHub Actions for automated tasks like web scraping. It teaches you how to configure your GitHub workflow to run at specific times or intervals using cron syntax. By scheduling actions, you can automate repetitive tasks such as regularly scraping data from websites and updating your datasets. This eliminates manual effort and ensures your data remains current, which is crucial for projects involving dynamic information. The video tutorial referenced provides a practical demonstration of setting up scheduled scraping within GitHub Actions.te Github Actions on a scheduled basis, which is a key component in automating web scraping tasks. The learning objective is to understand how to configure a workflow file in your repository to run scraping scripts automatically at specified intervals. In the context of scheduled scraping, this involves setting up a cron job within the `.github/workflows` directory to trigger the scraping action. By mastering this, students can ensure their scraping scripts run regularly, keeping the data updated without manual intervention. This setup avoids common errors related to inconsistent data collection and allows for reliable data pipelines in TDS projects.)](https://youtu.be/eJG86J200nM)
