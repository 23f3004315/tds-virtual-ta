Namaste Sir. The projects have been quite challenging, and I have applied my knowledge to the best of my ability. I’ve submitted the project but it’s showing 0 in the portal. Bonus marks for creating APIs and so in the projects would be greatly appreciated. I am planning to start my degree in the upcoming term, and this is the last subject I am completing at this level. So, I kindly request your assistance, sir.
