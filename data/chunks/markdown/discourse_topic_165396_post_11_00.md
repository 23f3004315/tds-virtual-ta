## Post #11 by Thinesh

Dear @s.anand sir,

For the TDS week 1 assignment, I have submitted it in the link (this link) that was mentioned in the graded assignment but I did not submit yes in the portal tab. Can you please help me out this one time??

I will make sure I submit it in both places next time.

I kindly request you to help me out this one time, as this will really impact my grade particularly as of this course.

I got a total of 9.5 in this assignment but as you can see in the image attached below I erred up with this submission
