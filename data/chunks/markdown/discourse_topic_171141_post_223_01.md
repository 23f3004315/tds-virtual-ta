**[Discussion Image by AryanTikam]** This image depicts a student's technical issue encountered during a TDS project, specifically related to LLM integration, in a peer discussion. The screenshot shows an HTTP 500 error response from the server, indicating "Task handling error: Failed to get LLM response after 3 attempts." The root cause appears to be a 401 error with the message "Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer," further classified as an "invalid_request_error" with the code "invalid_issuer." This suggests the student is using an authentication token that is either expired, incorrect, or not properly associated with the LLM service. The "Internal server error" indicates a problem with the backend processing of the authentication request, hinting that the student should focus on the correct token configuration and validation, as well as potentially reaching out for instructor guidance if backend issues persist. likely due to an incorrectly configured or expired token." alt="1000004176" data-base62-sha1="v9euyRFlunvnEWfZc7qWgGwUtop" width="690" height="259" srcset="**[Discussion Image by AryanTikam]** This image depicts a student's question on a TDS project, displaying an HTTP 500 error with details indicating "Task handling error: Failed to get LLM response after 3 attempts." The error code is 401, and the specific error message within the JSON response states: "'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'". This reveals an authentication problem related to the LLM's authentication token, potentially caused by an incorrect or expired token configuration. The error suggests troubleshooting steps should involve verifying the LLM's authentication setup and token validity to resolve the invalid issuer issue. The outermost error message simply states "Internal server error.", **[Discussion Image by AryanTikam]** This image depicts a student encountering an error during the TDS Project 1, specifically in post #223 of the "Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies" discussion. It shows an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error response, further detailing "Task handling error: Failed to get LLM response after 3 attempts: Error code: 401". The root cause identified in the error message is an authentication issue: "'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.'". The error type is 'invalid_request_error' with the specific code 'invalid_issuer', suggesting the token being used is not associated with the expected application or service. This likely indicates a misconfiguration of API keys or authentication settings, potentially related to an incorrect environment variable or a problem with the authentication process itself. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by AryanTikam]** This image depicts an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error encountered by a student during the TDS Project 1, specifically related to getting an LLM response. The error details indicate "Task handling error: Failed to get LLM response after 3 attempts". The underlying cause is an authentication issue, shown by "Error code: 401" and the message "Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer." The full error object displays further information, including "type": 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, and 'code': 'invalid_issuer', providing clues for troubleshooting the authentication configuration. This likely represents a student facing difficulty with API key setup or environment configuration required to access the LLM. 2x" data-dominant-color="141414">10000041761187Ã—446 55 KB
