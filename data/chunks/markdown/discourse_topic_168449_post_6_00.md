**[Discussion Image by carlton]** The image shows a Google icon, implying that a user may have either initiated or been directed to a Google search page while troubleshooting a coding or TDS problem during the "Mock ROE" assignment. This suggests that the student might be researching solutions, looking for documentation, or trying to resolve an error encountered during the exercise. The absence of additional context hinders a precise understanding of the student's specific issue or the outcome of their search, but it highlights a common problem-solving strategy involving external resources. The reliance on Google search underscores the importance of independent learning and information retrieval skills in technical courses like TDS.t question, instructor answer, peer discussion, error messages, code snippets, navigation steps, UI elements, troubleshooting procedures, solutions, workarounds, learning guidance, student confusion points, or resolution outcomes. The image is simply the Google logo and does not contain any of these elements. Therefore, I can not capture any technical content related to the student's learning." class="site-icon" data-dominant-color="D4D2CB" width="32" height="32">
