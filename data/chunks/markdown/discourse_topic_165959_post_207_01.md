**[Discussion Image by 22ds3000157]** The image shows a student facing a CORS error when attempting to validate their API endpoint in the TDS GA4 project, which is a question. The student has entered `http://localhost:8000/api/outline` into the "URL of your API endpoint?" field. After clicking "Check," the UI displays "TypeError: Load failed." The Chrome developer console shows "Fetch API cannot load" and "blocked" errors, stating that the page "requested insecure content from http://localhost:8000/api/outline?country=The+Bahamas" and that the content "was blocked and must" be loaded over HTTPS. This indicates a mixed content issue where a secure page (HTTPS) is attempting to load insecure content (HTTP), which is blocked by the browser's security policy, along with the CORS issue of accessing `localhost`. The core issue is likely that CORS is not correctly configured in the student's API to allow requests from the TDS exam environment or that their local server is serving content over HTTP instead of HTTPS when the exam page runs on HTTPS.that CORS is not properly configured on the localhost API, preventing the cross-origin request from succeeding. The instructions at the top outline the steps for API development including enabling CORS, suggesting this is an expected error if CORS is not configured correctly." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-09 at 12.28.48 PM" data-base62-sha1="umSId7GqlJiPY8BeusYOalPu9b3" width="690" height="498" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22ds3000157]** This image captures a student's attempt to connect their API endpoint with the TDS assessment platform, resulting in CORS-related errors. The student input "http://localhost:8000/api/outline" as the API endpoint, but the platform displays "TypeError: Load failed" and the browser console shows "[blocked] The page at https://exam.sanand workers.devitds-2025-01-ga4 requested insecure content from http://localhost:8000/api/outline?country=The+Bahamas. This content was blocked and must Not allowed to request resource Fetch API cannot load http://localhost:8000/api/outline?country=The+Bahamas due to access control checks." The errors indicate that the student's local API is being blocked by CORS policies, likely because the assessment platform (hosted on HTTPS) is trying to access the student's local development server (likely HTTP), triggering a mixed content security issue. This scenario clearly illustrates a common development hurdle where CORS configuration and HTTPS/HTTP protocols must be correctly managed to allow cross-origin requests between the assessment platform and the student's locally running API. The student needs to properly configure CORS headers on their FastAPI application to allow requests from the assessment platform's origin., **[Discussion Image by 22ds3000157]** This image shows a student's question and the error they encountered while trying to test their API endpoint for the TDS Jan 2025 GA4 assignment. The student is working on API development, specifically creating an endpoint that accepts a country query parameter. They entered `http://localhost:8000/api/outline` as the API endpoint URL and received a "TypeError: Load failed" message. The browser's console displays multiple "blocked" errors, indicating that the page hosted on `exam.sanand.workers.dev` is trying to load insecure content (HTTP) from `http://localhost:8000`, and the requests are blocked due to access control checks and CORS issues. The console also shows "Fetch API cannot load" errors. The student is likely facing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues because the API is hosted on `localhost` and being accessed from a different domain. The task instructions also mention enabling CORS. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22ds3000157]** This image shows a student working on the "GA4 - Data Sourcing" assignment and encountering CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) related issues. The student is attempting to make an API call to `http://localhost:8000/api/outline?country=The+Bahamas`, as instructed by the assignment, but the browser console shows a "TypeError: Load failed" error, followed by multiple "Fetch API cannot load" and "[blocked] The page... requested insecure content" errors due to access control checks. The errors indicate that the browser is blocking the request from the `exam.sanand.workers.dev` origin to the `localhost` origin because of CORS restrictions, which means the student hasn't correctly configured CORS on their local development server, specifically step #5 related to "Enabling CORS". The assignment instructions mention configuring appropriate CORS headers to allow GET requests from any origin, which the student needs to implement in their API. 2x" data-dominant-color="383031">Screenshot 2025-02-09 at 12.28.48 PM1304Ã—943 182 KB
