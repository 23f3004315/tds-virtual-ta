I started it once again. Can you please reevaluate it now if it hasn’t been done yet. I actually tested it till 3rd of April and it was working fine. I don’t know what actually happened. Please do consider.

Actually in the free tier there are many issues. These issues are beyond our control and I request the TDS team to please consider this issue and please consider re-evaluating it if it has not been done yet as we had put in a lot of efforts.
