**[Discussion Image by 22f3000804]** This image shows a student question in the TDS Jan 2025 GA4 discussion thread related to JSON data sourcing. The student asks "What is the JSON data?" and provides a sample of JSON data that includes fields like id, title, year, and rating for several movies or TV shows. An error message is also displayed below the JSON: "Error: At [10] year: Values don't match. Expected: "2021-". Actual: "2021-" ", which indicates a validation error occurring at the 10th record based on the year field. This suggests that the expected and actual values are not matching during some kind of validation process.al, suggesting there could be a hidden character or formatting problem causing the mismatch, and a need for careful inspection of the JSON data format or a potential schema mismatch." alt="Capture" data-base62-sha1="wNHXHx7hYmOR3ASOr5vTZwZyZfT" width="690" height="125" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f3000804]** This image shows a student question in the TDS "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]". The student asks "What is the JSON data?" and provides a JSON data snippet related to movie information including 'id', 'title', 'year', and 'rating'. An error message at the bottom of the displayed data indicates a data validation problem: "Error: At [10] year: Values don't match. Expected: "2021-". Actual: "2021-" ". This suggests the data validation process expects the 'year' value at the 10th record to start with "2021-", but the actual data does not match that expectation, leading to the reported error, possibly a misunderstanding between the expected and actual data formats, as the actual string likely contains values or a pattern not anticipated in the validation., **[Discussion Image by 22f3000804]** This image captures a student question in a TDS "GA4 - Data Sourcing" discussion thread, where the student is encountering an error with their JSON data. The provided JSON snippet contains movie data with fields such as "id", "title", "year", and "rating," with several movies listed. The error message "Error: At [10].year: Values don't match. Expected: "2021-". Actual: "2021-"" indicates a problem with the data validation or type checking specifically for the "year" field in the tenth record; likely caused by the formatting being inconsistent in "2021-2025" for "Squid Game" versus the expected four-digit year format, which then impacts validation of other year fields. The student is implicitly asking for help in understanding and resolving this JSON data validation error. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f3000804]** This image is a screenshot showing a student question about JSON data within the TDS GA4 discussion forum, specifically regarding data sourcing. The student provides a JSON data snippet, and the system returns an error message: "Error: At [10].year: Values don't match. Expected: "2021-". Actual: "2021-"". The JSON data contains fields for 'id', 'title', 'year', and 'rating' for several movies, but one of the records ("id":"tt10919420") lists a 'year' of "2021-2025", causing the validation error. This suggests the student is attempting to load this data and is facing a validation issue due to inconsistent year formats. 2x" data-dominant-color="2E2E34">Capture1119Ã—204 37.9 KB
