**[Discussion Image by Udipth]** This image shows a multiple-choice question from "Graded Assignment 6" in the TDS course, likely related to data science or business analytics. The question asks students to analyze key factors influencing motorcycle resale value, specifically focusing on mileage, daily distance, and engine capacity's impact on price retention for Yamaha in Maharashtra. Students are instructed to use the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, and the provided options represent correlation values for different factors: AvgDistance (0.09), Mileage (0.95), EngineCapacity (-0.02), and Mileage (0.12). The student has selected "Mileage: 0.95" as their answer, indicating they believe mileage has the strongest positive correlation with price retention. This implies the student is interpreting a high correlation coefficient as indicating a strong influence on resale value. seeking clarification or confirmation of their answer within the discussion forum." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="A4m6gPBqXgQhJ3fsG8iEiLd5pKQ" width="690" height="190" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Udipth]** This image depicts a multiple-choice question from "Graded assignment 6" in a TDS student discussion, likely from a data science or analytics course. The question asks the student to analyze factors influencing motorcycle resale value in Maharashtra using Pearson Correlation Coefficient and price retention (resale/original price), focusing on mileage, average distance, and engine capacity's impact on price retention for Yamaha. The student has selected the option "'Mileage: 0.95'", indicating they believe mileage has the strongest positive correlation with price retention based on the given Pearson coefficients. The available options include 'AvgDistance: 0.09', 'Mileage: 0.95', 'EngineCapacity: -0.02', and 'Mileage: 0.12'., **[Discussion Image by Udipth]** This image represents a question from a graded assignment in a TDS student discussion. The question asks students to analyze the key factors influencing motorcycle resale value in Maharashtra using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and considering mileage, average daily distance traveled, and engine capacity in relation to price retention. The student is prompted to select from four options representing the correlation coefficient values for different factors: 'AvgDistance: 0.09', 'Mileage: 0.95' (which is currently selected), 'EngineCapacity: -0.02', and 'Mileage: 0.12'. The selected answer indicates the student believes that mileage has the highest correlation (0.95) with price retention. The prompt defines price retention as (resale price / original price). 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Udipth]** This image shows a question from a graded assignment within the TDS student discussion "Graded assignment 6." The question, worth 1 point, asks the student to analyze the key factors influencing motorcycle resale value in Maharashtra, specifically the impact of mileage (km/l), average daily distance traveled, and engine capacity on price retention (%) for Yamaha using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. The student is presented with a multiple-choice question, where they must select the factor with the highest correlation coefficient. The available options are 'AvgDistance: 0.09', 'Mileage: 0.95', 'EngineCapacity: -0.02', and 'Mileage: 0.12', and the student has selected 'Mileage: 0.95'. 2x" data-dominant-color="F8F8F9">image2083Ã—575 47.6 KB
