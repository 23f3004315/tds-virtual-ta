deadline: 16th Feb 2025**), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.

**Course Structuring &amp; Scheduling Issues**

Many students pursuing this course are **dual-degree students or working professionals**, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.
The **last-minute guidance** for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.
The **structuring and scheduling of sessions** feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.

**Request for Improvement**
To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:

**Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2**, well in advance of the deadline.
**More structured and accessible support**, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.
**Better management of exam difficulty levels**, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.

I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.
