**[Discussion Image by 23f1001174]** This image depicts a student's attempt to answer a question about the JSON weather forecast for Sao Paulo, as part of a discussion in the TDS Jan 2025 cohort. The student provides a JSON object with date strings (e.g., "2025-02-08") as keys and weather descriptions as values. However, upon submitting the answer using the "Check" button, an error message appears: "Error: At root: Property name mismatch", which indicates that the provided JSON structure or content does not match the expected format or values for the problem. The student likely needs to revise the JSON structure or weather descriptions to align with the problem's requirements to resolve the "Property name mismatch" error. This is an example of a potential troubleshooting scenario during an interactive assignment.he JSON data, which includes date strings as keys and weather descriptions as values (e.g., "2025-02-08": "Partly cloudy and light winds"), is flagged with an error message "Error: At root: Property name mismatch," suggesting an issue with the structure or content of the provided JSON compared to the expected format. This error likely arises when the student presses the "Check" button after entering the JSON data. This highlights the student's struggle to correctly format the JSON response according to the course requirements, and suggests the student may need to review the expected JSON structure or data types." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="3tPVTb21saSQBGMiLBiTpO4xVxy" width="690" height="387" data-dominant-color="F2F1F3">image716×402 23.3 KB
