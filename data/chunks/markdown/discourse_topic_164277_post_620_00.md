@s.anand

@carlton sorry to disturb you, project1 deadline is over.

I made a mistake in my project. In my call llm function i set some payload instead of default for open ai api call like max token, temp. , n, stop etc.

Due to this, some tasks may fail especially credit card image task will fail 100%, if possible can i just remove that payload from git hub repository . or you can check this call llm function present in my task_handler.py file of my repository.

I found this issue after deadline. If possible consider this request. I never engaged in a project or course like for this one. I love this project genuinely.

my github repo : GitHub - 21f3001076/TDS_Project_1: This is IITM Data Science TDS Course Project 1 Repository

Thankyou
