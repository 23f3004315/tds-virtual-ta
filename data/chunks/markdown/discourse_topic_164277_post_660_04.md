**[Discussion Image by HARISH.S]** This image, taken from a student's discussion post on the TDS "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent," shows the contents of the "hello_world" directory. The directory, accessed via "This PC > OS (C:) > Users > hsent > hello_world", contains various files including ".git", "app.py" (a Python source file), "Dockerfile", "LICENSE", "README.md", and "requirements.txt". These files are essential for a Python project likely involving containerization and dependency management, suggesting a code development environment setup for the LLM automation agent project. The files sizes are each shown to be 1kb or 2kb. The student's exploration of the project's file structure is likely a step in understanding or troubleshooting a problem related to project setup or code execution.ated to a question about file structure, dependencies, or project organization, likely as part of peer discussion, where HARISH.S is providing visual context to his problem or setup. The absence of specific error messages suggests the issue may be conceptual or related to expected vs actual project structure." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="kpyOJTQ8silacxhloviYc9zXUVH" width="690" height="387" srcset="**[Discussion Image by HARISH.S]** This image, posted by HARISH.S in the TDS discussion thread for the LLM-based Automation Agent project, shows a student's "hello_world" project directory in Windows Explorer. The directory contains the files: `.git`, `app.py` (a Python source file), `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `README.md` (a Markdown source file), and `requirements.txt` (a text document). The navigation path at the top shows: "This PC > OS (C:) > Users > hsent > hello_world". This likely represents the state of a student's project directory structure, where they might be encountering issues related to file organization, dependency management (via `requirements.txt`), or building and deploying the application (using `Dockerfile`). The student's question in the forum is likely related to these files or their configuration within the LLM-based automation agent project, seeking guidance from instructors or peers., **[Discussion Image by HARISH.S]** This image depicts a student's file explorer window in Windows, showing the contents of the "hello_world" directory within their user folder ("hsent"). The files present include ".git" (a Git repository folder), "app.py" (a Python script), "Dockerfile", "LICENSE", "README.md", and "requirements.txt". The view indicates the student is likely navigating the file system or verifying the presence of project files for their LLM-based automation agent. This represents a troubleshooting or setup step where the student ensures necessary files are present, possibly in response to an error or guidance in the discussion thread. Thus, this is part of peer discussion and problem solving, since the student is showing what they have for context. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by HARISH.S]** This image depicts a student's file explorer view in the "hello_world" directory, likely related to project setup or troubleshooting within the TDS LLM-based Automation Agent discussion thread. Visible files include `.git`, `app.py`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, and `requirements.txt`, indicating a Python-based project with version control. The student is potentially verifying the correct project structure or file presence, as part of setting up their LLM-based automation agent project based on instructions. This confirms the student has set up the base project files needed for their project. 2x" data-dominant-color="1E1F1F">image1918Ã—1078 187 KB
