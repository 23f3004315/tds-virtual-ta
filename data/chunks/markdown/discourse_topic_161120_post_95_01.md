’ve been working on question 6 and I’m facing this error where the marks are not ordered properly. I believe my code appends the marks based on the names that are inputted in the backend but I’m unable to identify the source of this issue. Please shed some light on the same.

**[Discussion Image by 24f2006531]** This image shows a student encountering an error while configuring the Vercel URL for their deployed application in the "GA2 - Deployment Tools - Discussion Thread". The discussion reminds the student to enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin. The student enters "https://new1-ivory.vercel.app/api" as the Vercel URL, but receives an error message: "Error: Expected [73,73,53,63,61] but got [73,53,61,63,73]". This indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual URL format, likely due to a typo or incorrect URL structure during the configuration process. The expected URL format is provided as "https://your-app.vercel.app/api", highlighting the need to replace "your-app" with the correct application name.t suggests the student is being reminded to enable CORS for GET requests. The desired format for the Vercel URL is indicated as "https://your-app.vercel.app/api". The student's input resulted in an "Error: Expected [73,73,53,63,61] but got [73,53,61,63,73]", which is likely a byte array comparison that failed. This indicates an input mismatch between what the system expects and what the student provided, though the visible string appears correct." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="iX9uPoXGMrWWBbK3vZYmfGFKJmr" width="690" height="188" data-dominant-color="2C2E32">image858×234 14.2 KB
