**[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image captures a student's attempt to interact with a TDS project API using a `curl` command in a terminal. The command sends a POST request to an ngrok-hosted URL (likely a locally running server exposed to the internet via ngrok) with the content type set to `multipart/form-data`, sending a question about the number of Wednesdays within a specific date range as a parameter. The terminal output shows the successful response from the server, where the `answer` is "1121", indicating the number of Wednesdays between August 6, 1986, and January 29, 2008. The VS Code IDE in the background shows project files including `main.py`, suggesting the student is testing their API endpoint, focusing on sending data to the server and receiving the correct answer. This illustrates a peer discussion where a student is likely debugging/testing an API endpoint and shows both the request and the expected response.nd shows the `main.py` file from the `TDS-PROJECT-2.2` project, providing additional context regarding the code being tested." alt="Screenshot 2025-04-15 at 7.02.49 PM" data-base62-sha1="PWnjv5pPaqsulFKw0dGfNnASy" width="690" height="400" srcset="**[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image captures a student's troubleshooting step while working on Project 2, "TDS Solver." It depicts a student, likely GaURaVinDeX, using a `curl` command in a terminal to POST data to a ngrok-exposed endpoint. The curl command sends a "question" asking "How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-08-06 to 2008-01-29?" with the content type specified as "multipart/form-data". The terminal output shows the JSON response received from the server, giving the answer: `{"answer":"1121"}`. This indicates the student is testing the API endpoint with a direct request and verifying the response. The student is actively testing the functionality of their TDS solver through a command-line interface., **[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image shows a student, gauravghodge, testing the TDS solver API endpoint by sending a cURL POST request. The request is sent to the URL "https://4fd9-150-107-43-113.ngrok-free.app/api/" with the content type set to "multipart/form-data". The question being asked is "How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-08-06 to 2008-01-29?". The server responds with a JSON object containing the answer: "{\"answer\":\"1121\"}". This confirms a successful API request and response. The student is using the zsh shell on their MacBook Air. The IDE (likely VS Code) shows the main.py file open with imports from FastAPI, os, typing, and custom utils modules. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image depicts a student, Gauravghodge, working on the TDS Solver project and testing the API endpoint using a `curl` command in the terminal. The command sends a POST request to the specified ngrok URL (`https://4fd9-150-107-43-113.ngrok-free.app/api/`) with the `question` parameter set to "How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-08-06 to 2008-01-29?". The successful response from the API, displayed in the terminal, is `{"answer":"1121"}`, indicating the number of Wednesdays calculated for the given date range. The image also displays the `main.py` file from the `TDS-PROJECT-2.2` project, with imports such as `fastapi`, `File`, `UploadFile`, `Form`, `HTTPException`, `CORSMiddleware`, etc., suggesting that a FastAPI backend is being used. This demonstrates a peer discussion scenario where a student is showing a functional API call with a successful response. 2x" data-dominant-color="808283">Screenshot 2025-04-15 at 7.02.49 PM1920Ã—1114 94.8 KB
