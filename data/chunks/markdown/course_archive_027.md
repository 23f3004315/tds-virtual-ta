## Services to host web applications

[**[Course Image: Services to host web applications]** This image illustrates how to connect a Heroku application to a GitHub repository for streamlined deployment. Within the Heroku dashboard, you can link your app to a specific GitHub repository, enabling features like code diffs and automatic deployments from chosen branches. Pipelines can be created to connect multiple apps, and connecting to GitHub enables review apps and new pull request creation. Make sure that any tests have passed before pushing your code as every push to the branch will deploy a new version of your app. You can also choose a branch to deploy.ect a GitHub repository to a Heroku pipeline for deployment. The Heroku interface allows users to either create a new pipeline or add an existing app to one, and it also provides options for automatic deploys. Connecting to GitHub enables features like review apps and easier code review processes. Within the deployment methods section, the image highlights connecting to a GitHub repository and how to disconnect it. Furthermore, it demonstrates the configuration of automatic deploys, allowing changes pushed to a specific branch to be automatically deployed, ensuring that the branch is always in a deployable state.)](https://youtu.be/V5dl7zkKXC0)
