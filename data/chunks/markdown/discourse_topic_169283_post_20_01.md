 distance

Whose options provided are :

10418 meters

12287 meters

10965 meters

11149 meters

However, after trying all methods out there my distance comes out to be 6873 meters, I selected 10418 as the answer (closest approximation to 6873 meters)

I assume that the question must have been central command post to summit shores village (whose answer turns out to be 12287 meters)

Kindly look into the question, and let me know about the same (the destination from central command post)
