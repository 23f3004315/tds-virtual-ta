Sir,

Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query.

I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself).

I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th.

I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it.

Thankyou!
