## Image auto classification with Google Cloud Vision

[**[Course Image: Image auto classification with Google Cloud Vision]** The image illustrates the process of image auto-classification using Google Cloud Vision, specifically within the context of an "archive" project. It displays the Google Cloud Platform interface for a project named "global-harmony-328816," showcasing the Vision API and its image classification capabilities. The screenshot focuses on the "IMAGES" tab, where a dataset of 550 images is displayed, including examples labeled as "Bishop," "King," "Knight," "Pawn," and "Queen," suggesting chess pieces as the subject of image classification. A key function shown is the ability to filter images by label, add new labels, and generally manage the image dataset for training a machine learning model. This teaches how to leverage cloud-based tools for organizing and analyzing visual data, essential for archiving and retrieval tasks. Google Cloud Vision to classify images, specifically focusing on how to organize and manage your image datasets within the platform for archiving and later retrieval. The screenshot shows the Google Cloud Platform Vision interface where you can import, train, evaluate, and test image classification models. It highlights the "Images" tab where you can view "All images" (in this case 550), filter images by labels such as "Bishop," "King," "Knight," etc., which shows how to classify and then find images by type. The image is relevant to the "archive" topic because archiving involves storing data (in this case, images) in an organized and accessible manner for future use, and this interface allows users to categorize their images effectively for archival purposes.)](https://youtu.be/z4MUpn4FRTw)
