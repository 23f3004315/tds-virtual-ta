**[Discussion Image by 23f2001286]** This image depicts a student's data sourcing attempt that resulted in an error, originating from a TDS Jan 2025 GA4 discussion thread. The JSON data provided appears to be a list of movies or TV shows with 'id', 'title', 'year', and 'rating' fields. However, the system is throwing an error: "Error: At [11].title: Values don't match. Expected: "12. Graymail". Actual: "12. The Recruit"". This indicates a data validation failure where the expected title for item [11] (likely index 11 in a list) should have been "12. Graymail", but the actual data contained "12. The Recruit". The error suggests that the student's sourced data contains inconsistencies with the validation rules or the expected data format for the 'title' field at index 11.e processing JSON data; the data contains movie titles and related information such as IDs, years, and ratings. The error message "Error: At [11].title: Values don't match. Expected: \"12. Graymail\". Actual: \"12. The Recruit\"" suggests a data validation issue at the 11th element of the title field, indicating that the code expected "12. Graymail" but received "12. The Recruit." The issue likely arises because the student's script or process is using an incorrect or outdated data source or has a data transformation error that is causing the title to be "The Recruit" instead of what the validation expects, which is "Graymail."" alt="problem" data-base62-sha1="wlVOwnzJ7FXQqLgt8IPPqRTTuCU" width="621" height="159">problem621×159 42.4 KB
