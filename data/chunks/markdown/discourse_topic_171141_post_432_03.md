 issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.

Edit 2:

Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking.

**[Discussion Image by 22f3000819]** This image shows example Python code related to a project, likely posted by an instructor as a guide, given the disclaimer. The code uses `argparse` to handle command-line arguments for "email" and "--root" (defaulting to "/data"). It then creates a "config" dictionary to store these arguments and uses `os.makedirs` to create the root directory. Finally, it prints a disclaimer that the script is subject to change before evaluation and calls a series of functions `a2_format_markdown()`, `a3_dates()`, `a4_contacts()`, `a5_logs()`, `a6_docs()`, `a7_email()`, `a8_credit_card_image()`, `a9_comments()`, and `a10_ticket_sales()`.e arguments, specifically for "email" and "--root" (with a default value of "/data"). The code then creates a directory based on the "root" argument using `os.makedirs` and prints a disclaimer noting the script will change before evaluation, advising students to treat it as a guide. Finally, the code calls several functions named `a2_format_markdown()`, `a3_dates()`, and similarly named functions up to `a10_ticket_sales()`, which are presumably project-related tasks or modules. The code initializes a configuration dictionary `config` with "email" and "root" keys, storing the parsed command-line arguments." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="dDIQy9HZw7zCPuZ0utgGoCbXRkM" width="690" height="342" data-dominant-color="F9F9F9">image1027Ã—510 11 KB
