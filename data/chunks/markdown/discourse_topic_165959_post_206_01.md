**[Discussion Image by sharma_abhay]** This image depicts a student question within a TDS student discussion thread focused on GA4 data sourcing, where the student asks "What is the JSON data?" The student then pastes JSON data containing movie information, including 'id', 'title', and 'year' or 'rating', in array format. Below the JSON data, an error message is displayed stating "Error: At [0].id: Values don't match. Expected: 'tt20221436'. Actual: 'tt0437179'", indicating a data validation or data matching issue, specifically with the first element's 'id' field not matching an expected value. This suggests the student is encountering an issue with the JSON data not conforming to a predefined schema or expected values during import or processing, leading to the data mismatch error. JSON data structure containing movie information (id, title, year, rating). An error message is displayed below the JSON data, "Error: At [0].id: Values don't match. Expected: "tt20221436". Actual: "tt0437179"". This indicates a data validation issue where the first movie's ID (index 0) doesn't match the expected value, suggesting a potential problem with the data source or validation process. The student seeks clarification on the provided JSON data while encountering a data validation error. The error suggests the application expected an ID of "tt20221436" but instead received "tt0437179"." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="8yD6VG1SvqLTvLpj6YtmWNr8loG" width="690" height="251" data-dominant-color="2E3135">image706Ã—257 17.3 KB
