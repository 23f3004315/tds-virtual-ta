**[Discussion Image by 23f1000879]** This image shows a student's screenshot of a Dockerfile within a GitHub repository, likely from a project in the TDS (The Data Science) program, specifically related to discrepancies in "Tds-official-Project1". The Dockerfile sets up a Python 3.12 environment and installs various system and Python dependencies, including SciPy, FastAPI, Uvicorn, and others. It also adds the installed binary to the PATH, sets the working directory, copies application files, exposes port 8000, and defines the command to start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn. The student has added a handwritten annotation with the word "seiend" (likely intended as "friend"), suggesting a peer discussion or collaboration context. The code is also being analyzed by GitHub Copilot to improve coding speed.DD, and CMD instructions are used as part of the Dockerfile instructions." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="hfGGrCZc5ujQNmm1RFe8BSzkevt" width="690" height="377" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1000879]** This image shows a student's screenshot of a `Dockerfile` in a Github repository related to a TDS project, likely shared in the student discussion forum "Tds-official-Project1-discrepancies". The Dockerfile contains instructions for setting up a Python 3.12 environment, installing system dependencies (Scipy, etc.), installing Python packages (fastapi, uvicorn, etc.), ensuring the installed binary is on the PATH, copying application files, exposing port 8000, and starting the FastAPI server. The student is sharing the contents of the Dockerfile, potentially for review or to ask a question about its configuration. The screenshot highlights Github Copilot's code completion suggestion feature with "Code 55% faster with Github Copilot"., **[Discussion Image by 23f1000879]** This image shows a screenshot of a Dockerfile open in a Github repository, specifically as part of a TDS student discussion. The Dockerfile appears to be configured for a Python application, using `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` as the base image. It installs system dependencies using `apt-get`, installs the `uv` installer, and then installs Python packages using `pip`. The file also sets the PATH environment variable, sets the working directory, copies application files, exposes port 8000, and specifies the command to start the FastAPI server using `uvicorn`. A handwritten annotation "friend" is present in the upper right of the image which may be for obfuscation, or a casual annotation. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1000879]** This image shows a code snippet of a Dockerfile being discussed in the TDS "Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies" student discussion, and it looks like a student is asking their "seiend" or friend a question about it. The Dockerfile starts with a Python 3.12 base image, installs system dependencies for SciPy, installs 'uv', then installs required Python packages like fastapi, uvicorn, and scipy using pip. After that, the script sets the PATH, sets the working directory to /app, copies application files, exposes port 8000, and starts the FastAPI server. The use of "uv" for dependency management is notable. 2x" data-dominant-color="13171D">image1670Ã—914 67.9 KB
