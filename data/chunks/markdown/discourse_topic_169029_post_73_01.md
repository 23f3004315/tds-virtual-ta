 with rudimentary elements, representing potential vehicles or objects within a simulation environment. The student likely uses this as a demonstration for visualization and collision detection. The scene highlights core visual concepts to be implemented in the TDS Solver project..

My doubt is, what will be the value of file attribute in curl command

---

Will it be

“file=binary of zipfile/csv/json” for the first type and
“file=**[Discussion Image by 23f2000573]** This image is a visual representation likely related to the TDS Solver project, showing a black background with a red square in the top left, a green circle in the top right, a blue horizontal line approximately centered vertically, and a yellow triangle in the bottom center. The shapes and their positions might represent components, states, or outputs in a TDS (Tractable Decision Support) system or simulation being developed in the project. Without further context, it's hard to discern the specific meaning of the shapes but they appear to be a visual abstraction of the problem domain within the scope of the TDS project being discussed. The discussion is likely centered on interpreting or rendering these shapes correctly within the TDS Solver application. This graphic could be a model, a simulation state, or a test case in Project 2.” for the second type

This is correct html table format.

Will this table be in the “question” attribute of curl or “file” attribute

In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2.

so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the “question” attribute and the image in the “file” attribute?
