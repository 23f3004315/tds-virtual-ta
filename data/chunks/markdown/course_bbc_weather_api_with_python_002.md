## BBC Weather data with Python

[**[Course Image: Scrape BBC weather with Python]** This image introduces the concept of scraping BBC weather data using Python, as part of the "Tools in Data Science" course. The goal is to teach you how to extract weather information from the BBC website using Python programming. This involves using libraries and techniques to access the website's HTML content and parse it to retrieve relevant weather data. Mastering this will enable you to automate weather data collection and analysis in your data science projects. The instructor for this module is Anand S, and the tutorial instructor is Dibu Philip.weather data from the BBC using Python for data science applications. Specifically, it covers the process of scraping BBC Weather data using Python. This is a component of the "Tools in Data Science" course and is taught by Instructor Anand S and Tutorial Instructor Dibu Philip. The learning objective is to extract real-world data using web scraping techniques in Python, which can then be used for analysis and modeling. This skill is valuable for building custom weather APIs or integrating weather data into data analysis projects.)](https://youtu.be/Uc4DgQJDRoI)
