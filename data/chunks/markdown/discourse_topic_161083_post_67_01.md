@23f2005067 @23f2003751 I added a “Recent saves” feature.

This will show the time and score for the last 3 times you saved. You can load from any of these.

**[Discussion Image by s.anand]** This image is from a student discussion on development tools for the TDS Jan 2025 course, specifically in post #67 by user s.anand. It shows a section titled "Recent saves" within the development environment. Three save entries are listed, each with a "Reload" button, a timestamp indicating when the save occurred, and a "Score" value associated with that save. The saves are from 19/1/2025 at 8:17:25 pm with a score of 1.25, 19/1/2025 at 8:01:54 pm with a score of 0.25, and 14/1/2025 at 9:23:11 pm with a score of 0. The context suggests this is part of the game development process and the scores reflect the player's progress at the point of each save.game states with timestamps and scores: "19/1/2025, 8:17:25 pm. Score: 1.25", "19/1/2025, 8:01:54 pm. Score: 0.25", and "14/1/2025, 9:23:11 pm. Score: 0". Each save has a "Reload" button, allowing the student to revert to a previous game state. The scores likely represent the student's performance at the time of each save, potentially used for debugging or comparing strategies. This snippet provides context to a discussion about game development tools, allowing students to discuss saving, loading, and scorekeeping mechanics." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="tsDs6TuN8b4S4JxFXIYSl9kGajR" width="368" height="152">image368×152 5.35 KB
