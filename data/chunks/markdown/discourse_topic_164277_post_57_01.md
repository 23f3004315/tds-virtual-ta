**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image captures a section of project deliverables instructions, acting as instructor guidance for TDS students in "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent." It lists the steps required for completing the project, including creating a GitHub repository, writing and testing code with POST/run?task= and GET/read?path= endpoints, creating a Dockerfile, publishing the Docker image, and verifying the image runs using `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=SAIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`. A key instruction, highlighted by an arrow, guides students to "Submit in this Google Form the URL of your GitHub repository" with a placeholder URL of `(https://github.com/user-name/repo-name)` and Docker image name. The instructions also emphasize using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable and discourage committing the AI proxy token directly to the repository, instructing students to instead set it with `os.environ["AIPROXY_TOKEN"]`. Finally, it warns students about the Al Proxy token having a $1 limit and advises using the GPT-4o-Mini model, emphasizing concise prompts with calls to `/run` and `/read` limited to 20 seconds.tory URL and Docker image name in a Google Form, with a placeholder link provided. The instructions also emphasize using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` as an environment variable, avoiding committing it to the repository, sticking to the `GPT-4o-Mini` model, keeping prompts short, and limiting `/run` and `/read` calls to 20 seconds." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-03 at 6.27.39 pm 1" data-base62-sha1="kUeQpf8MMOL4Iezh7zL7bTgwg5M" width="642" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image shows a section of the "Deliverables" page for Project 1, likely an LLM-based automation agent project, from a Tools in Data Science (TDS) course. It provides a list of tasks students need to complete for the project, including creating a GitHub repository, writing and testing code, creating a Dockerfile, publishing the Docker image, and ensuring the image runs properly using `podman`. Critically, the section highlighted by an arrow and in bold text states that students must "Submit in this Google Form the URL of your GitHub repository" and their Docker image name, providing the required format `(https://github.com/user-name/repo-name) (user-name/repo-name)`. The page also includes important notes regarding the use of the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable, suggesting students should set it using `os.environ["AIPROXY_TOKEN"]` instead of committing it to the repository, mentioning a $1 limit for the AI Proxy token and advising to stick to the GPT-4o-Mini model, and keep prompts short and concise. This suggests that the discussion thread in post #57 involves clarification or troubleshooting steps related to these project deliverables, repository submission, environment variables, token usage, model constraints, and prompt engineering guidelines., **[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image shows the "Deliverables" section of "Project 1" in a TDS (Tools in Data Science) course. It outlines the steps required to complete and submit the project, including creating a public GitHub repository, adding an MIT license, writing and testing code using POST `/run?task=...` and GET `/read?path=...` calls, creating a Dockerfile, publishing the Docker image, and ensuring the image runs via `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`. A key instruction, highlighted with a red arrow, directs students to "Submit in this Google Form the URL of your GitHub repository" with the example URL format `https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`, along with their Docker image name. The section also provides important notes regarding the use of the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable, usage limits for the AI Proxy token, the recommended GPT-4o-Mini LLM model, and time limits for `/run` and `/read` calls. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image is a screenshot from the "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent" deliverables section in the TDS (Tools in Data Science) student discussion forum. The image provides instructions for project submission, including creating a public GitHub repository with an MIT LICENSE, writing and testing code using POST/run?task=... and GET/read?path=... calls, creating and publishing a Dockerfile, ensuring the image runs via `podman`, and submitting the GitHub repository URL via Google Form. It highlights the importance of using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable and sticking to the GPT-4o-Mini LLM, while emphasizing concise prompts within 20-second limits for /run and /read calls. The student question is about the specific requirements for the Deliverables, focusing on the repository URL submission. 2x" data-dominant-color="F3F2F2">Screenshot 2025-02-03 at 6.27.39 pm 12268Ã—1766 491 KB
