**[Discussion Image by 23f3003871]** This image captures a student's attempt to provide a JSON weather forecast description for Kuala Lumpur in the TDS Jan 2025 GA4 discussion thread. The student presents a single-day forecast: `{"2025-02-01": "Thundery showers and light winds"}`. This contrasts with the example output, which includes multiple days (2025-01-01, 2025-01-02, 2025-01-03, and "additional days"). The student submission results in an error: "Error: At root: Different number of properties," indicating a mismatch in the expected JSON structure, most likely requiring multiple days of forecast data instead of a single day. The issue highlights the student's misunderstanding of the required JSON format based on the given example.tes a mismatch in the expected structure or number of properties in the JSON object, implying the solution might require including multiple dates rather than just one." alt="question4" data-base62-sha1="leP2GSOymBtPWgMAn5lwjnOYm5q" width="641" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f3003871]** This image shows a student question in the TDS GA4 discussion thread related to JSON formatting. The problem is a student's attempt to provide a JSON weather forecast description for Kuala Lumpur, which returns an error "Error: At root: Different number of properties". The expected output example shown is a JSON object with multiple daily weather forecasts. However, the student's submitted answer contains only a single day's forecast, leading to the error because it does not match the expected JSON structure which has multiple properties (days with weather)., **[Discussion Image by 23f3003871]** This image captures a student's attempt to provide a JSON weather forecast description, likely for an assignment in the TDS Jan 2025 GA4 course. The student is asked to define the JSON weather forecast description for Kuala Lumpur. The student provides the JSON: `{"2025-02-01": "Thundery showers and light winds"}`. However, the system returns an error: "Error: At root: Different number of properties", indicating that the provided JSON does not match the expected structure, likely in terms of the number of key-value pairs or nested objects, as demonstrated by the sample JSON provided which contains multiple dates. The student is likely struggling to format the JSON output to the required specification. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f3003871]** This image depicts a student question in the TDS Jan 2025 GA4 discussion thread regarding JSON weather forecast descriptions, specifically for Kuala Lumpur. The student provides a JSON payload `{"2025-02-01": "Thundery showers and light winds"}` as their answer, after being shown an example output structure containing multiple dates and weather descriptions like `"2025-01-01": "Sunny with scattered clouds"`. The response generates an error: "Error: At root: Different number of properties," indicating the student's JSON does not match the expected structure, which expects multiple date entries, not just one. The student is likely confused about the expected JSON format for a series of weather forecasts versus a single day's forecast. The problem is that the answer only has one date when the expected format should contain multiple dates. 2x" data-dominant-color="A2A4A7">question4692Ã—539 36.3 KB
