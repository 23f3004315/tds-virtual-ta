**[Discussion Image by 23f2000573]** This image is a code snippet shared in the "GA2 - Deployment Tools - Discussion Thread" on TDS, likely as part of a student question or solution. It shows a Python function definition for an API endpoint using FastAPI. The `@app.get("/api")` decorator indicates that this function will handle GET requests to the "/api" endpoint. The `api` function has a parameter `class_` which is type-hinted using `Annotated` to be either a list of strings or None, and it's specified as a query parameter using `Query(alias='class')`. This implies that the API expects a query parameter named "class" which, if provided, should be a list of strings.name 'class_' is used to avoid conflicts with the keyword 'class'." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="y3BQJYAacECp1pIQdZimM98SLLk" width="690" height="51" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2000573]** This image depicts a code snippet from a TDS student discussion about deployment tools, specifically focusing on an API endpoint definition within a Python application, likely using FastAPI or a similar framework. The code defines a GET route "/api" using the `@app.get` decorator. The function `api` takes a parameter `class_`, which is annotated using `Annotated` and specified as either a list of strings (`list[str]`) or `None`, with an associated query parameter alias "class" using `Query(alias='class')`. This configuration allows the API to accept a query parameter named "class" and map it to the `class_` parameter within the function. The default value for this parameter is set to `None`. This represents a student's question about how to properly define an API endpoint that accepts a list of strings as a query parameter, utilizing Python's type hinting and FastAPI's query parameter handling capabilities, and awaits response., **[Discussion Image by 23f2000573]** This image is from a student discussion thread about deployment tools and shows a Python code snippet. The code defines an API endpoint using the FastAPI framework, specifically the `@app.get("/api")` decorator, creating a GET route for the `/api` path. The `api` function accepts an optional query parameter named `class_`, which is type-hinted using `Annotated` to be either a list of strings or None, and is aliased as "class" in the query. The default value for `class_` is set to None. This snippet is likely related to a student's question about defining and handling query parameters in their FastAPI application, potentially facing confusion about aliasing and optional types. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2000573]** This image shows a code snippet of a Python function definition, likely from a FastAPI application based on the `@app.get("/api")` decorator, indicating a GET request endpoint. The function `api` takes a parameter `class_` which is annotated with `Annotated[list[str] | None, Query(alias='class')] = None`. This indicates that the `class_` parameter is expected to be a list of strings or None, and it is sourced from a query parameter named 'class'. The use of `Query(alias='class')` suggests that the parameter name in the URL query string will be 'class', even though the parameter in the function definition is named `class_` to avoid conflict with the Python keyword `class`. It appears to be a part of a student's work, and the post likely aims to clarify or showcase the parameter handling for API endpoints. 2x" data-dominant-color="272A2A">
