**[Discussion Image by Rishabh2]** This image shows a multiple-choice question from a graded assignment, specifically question 9, focusing on an evacuation strategy. The question describes four communities (Oak Park Town, East Springs Settlement, East Fields Junction, Red Point Town) and the Central Command Post, each with given coordinates. The task is to determine the optimal evacuation sequence using the "nearest community first" strategy. Four potential evacuation sequences are provided as multiple-choice answers, with the first option selected. A code snippet is visible at the bottom, using the haversine library, likely intended for calculating distances between coordinates to assist in solving the problem.ry, used to calculate distances between latitude and longitude coordinates, with OakParkTown location initialized, suggesting a potential coding approach to solve the problem." alt="Screenshot 2025-03-15 205456" data-base62-sha1="90Bt4FXPELiOL7vTo120QRInE" width="690" height="189" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Rishabh2]** This image shows a multiple-choice question from a graded assignment focusing on determining the optimal evacuation sequence for four communities based on their proximity to a central command post, utilizing a "nearest community first" strategy. The question provides the coordinates of each community (Oak Park Town, East Springs Settlement, East Fields Junction, Red Point Town) and the Central Command Post. Four potential evacuation sequences are given as options, starting and ending at 'Start/End', and the student must select the correct order. There's also a code snippet visible, importing the haversine library to calculate distances between coordinates, which helps determine the "nearest community." The question requires students to apply the shortest path distance concept to evacuate communities in the most efficient sequence., **[Discussion Image by Rishabh2]** This image shows a multiple-choice question from a graded assignment asking students to determine the optimal evacuation sequence using the "nearest community first" strategy, based on the given coordinates of four communities (Oak Park Town, East Springs Settlement, East Fields Junction, and Red Point Town) and a central command post. The question provides the coordinates for each location, and students must select the evacuation order that minimizes the overall travel distance to the command post. The student has selected the first option: ['Start/End', 'East Fields Junction', 'East Springs Settlement', 'Oak Park Town', 'Red Point Town', 'Start/End']. A code snippet showing the import statement "from haversine import haversine" and variable assignments for coordinates (e.g., "OakParkTown = (27.0096, -72.3822)") suggests the student is using Python and the haversine library to calculate distances. The student is attempting to calculate and select the best sequence based on the shortest distances. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Rishabh2]** This image shows a multiple-choice question from a graded assignment focusing on determining the optimal evacuation sequence for four communities based on the "nearest community first" strategy relative to a central command post. The question provides the coordinates for each community (Oak Park Town, East Springs Settlement, East Fields Junction, Red Point Town) and the Central Command Post. Four possible evacuation sequences are presented as answer options, starting and ending with 'Start/End'. The student appears to be working on this question using Python, as indicated by the code snippet at the bottom showing the import of the `haversine` library and the definition of coordinates for OakParkTown; the rest of the code may show the distance calculations being used to find the closest community at each step. The student will need to determine the shortest distances between the command post and each community and then update those distances after each evacuation to ultimately choose the optimal sequence. 2x" data-dominant-color="F1F1F1">Screenshot 2025-03-15 2054561333×366 45.8 KB
