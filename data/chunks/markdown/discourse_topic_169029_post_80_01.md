The correct answer has to be with the escape sequence otherwise you cannot send a valid response back.

We never feed your response to the GA by copy pasting.

**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image depicts a student's code snippet and its output in the context of a TDS solver project discussion. The student is experimenting with JSON serialization and deserialization to handle the challenge prompt. Initially, a `response` dictionary is created, with the "answer" key containing a string representation of a JSON object, which is then serialized to JSON using `json.dumps` and printed. Next, the serialized JSON string is loaded back into a Python dictionary using `json.loads`, and then the 'answer' key is accessed and printed, revealing nested structure, and finally the student expresses excitement about the successful parsing and extraction of the challenge. The code shows the student's journey in understanding how to manipulate JSON strings within the TDS solver context.ject is "How can TDS ever hope to solve this problem?"." data-base62-sha1="deP2pMybh5yRzmVh5z6MoDlehu3" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-21 at 5.28.12 pm.png" width="562" height="349" srcset="**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image shows a student's successful attempt to serialize a Python dictionary into JSON and then deserialize a specific part of that JSON back into a Python dictionary. The initial `response` dictionary is defined with a key `"answer"` that holds a JSON string. The `json.dumps()` function is used to convert this dictionary into a JSON string with indentation for readability, which is stored in `send_response` and printed. Subsequently, `json.loads()` is used to parse the `send_response` string back into a Python dictionary, and the value associated with the key `"answer"` is extracted into the `tds_evaluator` variable, which is then printed, demonstrating that the nested JSON string was correctly parsed and accessed. The final print statement displays a message expressing the student's excitement., **[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image shows a student's successful attempt to parse a JSON string in the TDS solver project. The student initializes a dictionary called `response` with the key "answer" having a string value, which itself is a JSON-like string containing an "args" key with a "challenge" key. The `json.dumps` function is used to serialize the `response` dictionary to a JSON string with indentation for readability and printed to the console. Then, `json.loads` is used to parse the `send_response` JSON string into a Python dictionary, after which the student accesses the value associated with the "answer" key, and stores the string value in the `tds_evaluator` variable. This `tds_evaluator` string is printed, showing that the nested JSON-like string was successfully extracted. The student then celebrates the success with a print statement. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image shows a student successfully extracting the "challenge" from a nested JSON response in the TDS solver project. The student first defines a `response` dictionary with a nested string value under the "answer" key. They then use `json.dumps` to convert the dictionary into a JSON string with indentation, storing the result in `send_response` and printing it. Subsequently, they use `json.loads` to parse the `send_response` string back into a Python dictionary, accesses the value associated with the 'answer' key and assigns the result to `tds_evaluator`, and prints the result. The final print statement shows the extracted dictionary containing the "challenge". 2x" data-dominant-color="262626">Screenshot 2025-03-21 at 5.28.12 pm.png1744Ã—1084 147 KB
