**[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image shows an automated email from the TDS course (sender "22t1 se2002") providing a learner with feedback on their Project 1 prerequisite checks. The email details five required conditions, including having a publicly accessible GitHub repository with a LICENSE file and a valid Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image that can be run via podman with a specified command: `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`. The evaluation results at the bottom show that while the Docker image is correctly present and public, the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license are all failing the checks, resulting in a "Prerequisites: FAIL" and a "Project 1 Score: 0". The student needs to address these failures related to their GitHub repository setup to proceed with the project.file and MIT license in the root of the repo all failed (FAIL), resulting in a failing prerequisite status and a project score of 0. Therefore, the student needs to address these issues to get their submission evaluated." alt="1000105386" data-base62-sha1="iaQhsusUKxcxiJH2300WMPkeWv9" width="299" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image shows an automated email sent to a student regarding their Project 1 prerequisite evaluations, indicating a peer discussion about project setup. The email details the project's requirements, including having a public GitHub repository with a LICENSE file and a valid Dockerfile, and ensuring the Docker image is publicly accessible and runnable via a specified `podman run` command, specifying environment variables and port mapping, and that the Dockerfile in Dockerhub matches the GitHub repo's. The email indicates that the student's Docker image is present and public in Dockerhub (PASS), but the GitHub repo is not present or public, and both the Dockerfile and MIT license are missing from the root of the GitHub repo (FAIL). The student failed the pre-requisites, leading to a project score of 0, and the email also stated "Your submission will not get evaluated" if failing these minimum requirements., **[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image shows an instructor email providing feedback on Project 1 prerequisites. The email outlines five requirements: a publicly accessible GitHub repository, an MIT license, a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image that runs correctly, and the Docker image using the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository. The email then presents the student's Project 1 prerequisite evaluations, indicating that while the Docker image is present and public, the GitHub repository itself, the Dockerfile, and the MIT license are missing from the root of the repository. The student failed the prerequisites, resulting in a project score of 0, because the github repository, dockerfile, and MIT license were not found. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image shows an email from a course instructor to a student regarding the prerequisite checks for Project 1 in the TDS course, specifically related to an LLM-based automation agent. The email outlines the requirements for the project, including having a public and accessible GitHub repository, a LICENSE file with the MIT license, a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image that runs via podman, and using the same Dockerfile in the GitHub repository as the one used to build the image. The email also details the student's current prerequisite evaluations, showing that the Docker image is present and public but the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license are not correctly detected in the repository, leading to a FAIL status and a project score of 0. The student needs to ensure the GitHub repository is public, the Dockerfile exists in the root of the repository, and that the MIT license file is also present in the root of the repository to pass the prerequisites and proceed with the project evaluation. 2x" data-dominant-color="252A29">10001053861072Ã—1787 256 KB
