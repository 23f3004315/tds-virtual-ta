Dear @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj , and @Saransh_Saini

Thank you all for this wonderful project. Coming from a non-coding background, I have learned a lot new things throughout this project building process.

@carlton Sir, yesterday’s session provided valuable insights into Method 1 (prompt engineering) for dynamically handling tasks. I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly.

Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.

I sincerely appreciate everyone’s guidance and support.
