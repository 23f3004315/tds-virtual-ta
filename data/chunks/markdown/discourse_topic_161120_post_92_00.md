## Post #92 by 24f2006531

**Direct Link**: [Post #92](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/161120/92)

Once i close my local llm and close the nrgrok URL (after entering the answer and the answer being correct), the next time I refresh or check the answer in the Ga2 site, q10 gets marked wrong. I have to redo the entire process for it to be correct again.

Can you clarify why this is happening?
