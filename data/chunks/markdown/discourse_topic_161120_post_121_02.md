 unrelated to the primary problem but flags a potential issue with form structure. This indicates the student is examining the API response and request details to verify the data and performance. 2x" data-dominant-color="F3F4F6">image1903×657 83.4 KB

**[Discussion Image by 24ds1000082_Vivek]** This image shows a student post in the TDS Jan 2025 "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion thread. The student, Vivek, is displaying JSON data fetched from the URL `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=SN&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`. The JSON output shows an array of objects, each representing a student with a `studentId` and `class` attribute. The browser's console is also visible, showing a warning "A form field element should have an id or name attribute," which may or may not be related to the displayed data. It seems Vivek is displaying data retrieved through an API call related to student information and their classes.itself. This suggests the student is trying to debug data retrieval and possibly address UI warnings within their deployment environment." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="e4hLoQg2jV3NbXyqGipDLED9XJm" width="690" height="270" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 24ds1000082_Vivek]** This image depicts a student, Vivek, viewing JSON data returned from a local API endpoint `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=SN&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W` in their Chrome browser. The data appears to be a list of student IDs and their corresponding classes, formatted as `{"studentId": number, "class": "class_name"}`. The student has opened the browser's developer console, specifically the "Console" tab, and is viewing the JSON output in the main window. The console also displays an "Issues" tab notification indicating "A form field element should have an id or name attribute," suggesting a potential HTML issue unrelated to the API data itself., **[Discussion Image by 24ds1000082_Vivek]** This image shows a student's browser displaying JSON data fetched from a local API endpoint. The student is accessing the URL `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W` which returns a list of student objects, each containing a `studentId` and a `class` property. The browser's developer console (specifically the "Console" tab) is open, but it doesn't show any errors related to the API call itself. It shows a single issue reported as: "A form field element should have an id or name attribute", which is unrelated to API. This indicates the student is checking the API response, likely as part of debugging or validating the API's functionality, and is not encountering errors from API. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 24ds1000082_Vivek]** This image shows a student (24ds1000082_Vivek) sharing output from an API call within a discussion thread regarding deployment tools. The student has accessed the API at `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`, and the response is a JSON array of student objects, each containing `studentId` and `class` properties, for example `{"studentId":57,"class":"5N"}`. The image also shows the Chrome DevTools console, specifically the "Issues" tab indicating "A form field element should have an id or name attribute," but this seems unrelated to the primary API output being shared, and could be a warning from another part of the page. This share likely relates to a problem or question about how the API is behaving with the specified class parameters. 2x" data-dominant-color="F4F5F7">image1914×751 82.1 KB
