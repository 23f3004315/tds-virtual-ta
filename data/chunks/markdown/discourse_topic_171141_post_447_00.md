## Post #447 by 23f1001822

**Direct Link**: [Post #447](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/171141/447)

**Subject:** Request for Verification of Dockerfile and Reevaluation of Marks for Project 1

@carlton @Jivraj

Sir,

Regarding the recent feedback on **Project 1** for **TDS**, it was mentioned that there is no Dockerfile in my GitHub repo. However, the Dockerfile is named **`dockerfile`** (not **`Dockerfile`**). Please verify the repository again with this in mind.

Additionally, my Docker image architecture is *linux/amd64* (64-bit **x86**). I have also filled out the **Architecture Information Collector** form as requested.

**Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)**

Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1

Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1

Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1

Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 0
