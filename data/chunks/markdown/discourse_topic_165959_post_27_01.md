**[Discussion Image by daksh76]** This image shows a student, daksh76, encountering an error while entering their GitHub repository URL into a system that requests the URL in the format "https://github.com/USER/REPO". The student enters "https://github.com/dakshagarwal76/daily-update", but receives the error "Error: No executed job step matches 23f3000264@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". This indicates a potential issue with the backend job execution or authentication within the TDS system. The student is likely seeking help understanding why the provided repository URL is resulting in this job-related error, indicating a student question about the proper data sourcing procedure.s://github.com/USER/REPO):" and the student, daksh76, has entered "https://github.com/dakshagarwal76/daily-update". However, an error message is displayed beneath the input field, stating "Error: No executed job step matches 23f3000264@ds.study.iitm.ac.in", suggesting an issue with the assignment setup or execution environment rather than the URL itself. This likely indicates a problem on the backend relating to a specific job or user identifier within the data science study platform at IITM, rather than a formatting issue with the repository URL. The student will need to seek assistance from the course instructors or platform administrators to resolve this error, as it is not related to the correctness of the URL." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="zhiE4fow6T3t7g9USSiP1KZuhvG" width="690" height="134" data-dominant-color="333236">image703Ã—137 9.75 KB
