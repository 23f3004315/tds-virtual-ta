 message about the infinity mirror issue. Understanding how to properly share content during live sessions is crucial for effective communication and avoiding technical difficulties when scraping data from these sessions. By sharing a specific tab or window, you can better control the information being displayed and minimize distractions during the scraping process.)](https://youtu.be/I3auyTYORTs)

[**[Course Image: Intermediate web scraping use of cookies]** This image demonstrates an initial step in scraping data from a live Google Meet session, specifically focusing on obtaining a list of participants. It shows a Google Meet interface with the "People" tab open, displaying a list of attendees, including the user ("Amit Kumar Gupta") and other participants like "AANANTHA PRIYA S M", "ABHISHEK PANDEY", etc. The image also shows a Colab notebook, which is where the scraping code would eventually reside, emphasizing the intention to programmatically access and extract the attendee information seen on the Google Meet interface. Understanding how to extract participant names from a live session is crucial for tasks like attendance tracking or identifying active contributors, and serves as a foundational skill for more advanced scraping tasks. This visual context sets the stage for the more technical code-related steps that would follow in the "scraping-live-sessions" curriculum.mparison of a Google Meet session and a Google Colab notebook, demonstrating a scenario where you might scrape data from a live online session. The Google Meet window displays a list of participants, visible after clicking the "People" icon, which is useful for understanding the structure of the HTML you will scrape. On the right, the Colab notebook serves as the environment for writing and executing the scraping code, likely using libraries like Beautiful Soup or Selenium to extract the participant data or other relevant information from the Meet session's web page. Understanding the live session's layout and how to access participant lists is a crucial step before writing any scraping code. The image suggests the live session provides dynamic content to scrape, as attendees can join and leave, requiring real-time or near real-time data capture techniques.)](https://youtu.be/DryMIxMf3VU)
