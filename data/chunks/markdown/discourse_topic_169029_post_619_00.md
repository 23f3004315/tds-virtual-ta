## Post #619 by JerinJohn01

Dear @Jivraj @carlton

In the google form which we submitted I had pasted the API endpoint as the one which I got in the vercel dashboard i.e. https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/

whereas the correct api for giving post requests has **/api** added to the above which i forgot to add. i.e**.https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/api/**

I have checked again and the post requests are working.

I know that I made a mistake in the form and regret the same. If possible, please evaluate my project 2 with the above endpoint
