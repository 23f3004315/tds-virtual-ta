I tried downloading image for your dataset it is 2.36 KB in size.

Using base64 encoded string from `image_url.url` in your code when decoded comes out to be 8.18 KB, when I encoded image from your dataset and decoded it was 2.36 KB.

**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image depicts the output of a Base64 decoder, likely used in a student's troubleshooting process during the TDS GA3 Large Language Models discussion. It shows a lengthy Base64 encoded string in a text area, followed by a "Decode Base64 to Image" button, implying a conversion process. Below this, a "Preview Image" section displays the decoded image: a yellow rectangle containing the string "21f3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in 92893354", suggesting that the original image was just this text. "File Info" provides details such as resolution (757x66), MIME type (image/png), extension (png), size (8.18KB), and bit depth (8). The presence of the email-like address potentially indicates the student was experimenting with generating or manipulating image data, perhaps for some task related to the course or assignment, and using base64 to encode/decode the pixel data.y, the "File Info" section provides details such as resolution (757x66), MIME type (image/png), extension (png), size (8.18 KB), download link, and bit depth (8). This demonstrates the successful decoding of an image from a Base64 string." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="oknbSV792DrYiCsWVmZx3riC6ON" width="690" height="347" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image depicts an interactive tool for decoding Base64 encoded data into an image, likely part of a learning module on data representation or image processing within the TDS course. The interface shows a large text area containing Base64 encoded data prefixed with "data:image/png;base64," along with buttons to "copy", "clear" and "download" the data. Below this, a "Decode Base64 to Image" button allows conversion, displaying a preview of the decoded image containing the text "21f3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in 92893354", which is highlighted in yellow. File info provides the image's resolution (757x66), MIME type (image/png), extension (png), size (8.18 KB), and bit depth (8), with a link to download the image., **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image shows a debugging interface in response to a student's question related to GA3 and large language models. It contains a long, encoded base64 string intended to represent an image, likely data passed between the LLM and the interface. The interface also displays a "Decode Base64 to Image" button, which, when clicked, renders a "Preview Image," which in this case is the text "21f3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in 92893354," highlighted in yellow. The interface also displays image file information, such as resolution (757x66), MIME type (image/png), extension (png), size (8.18 KB), a download link, and bit depth (8), suggesting the process of converting the base64 string into a viewable image file. It's not clear if this is successful or if this is a troubleshooting step being presented. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image shows a tool used to decode Base64 encoded data into an image, likely as part of a student discussion on Large Language Models (LLMs). The interface includes a text area where a Base64 encoded string is pasted, along with buttons to "copy", "clear", and "download". When decoded, the tool displays a "Preview Image" which contains the string "21f3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in 92893354" highlighted in yellow, suggesting it's an email address or identifier. File information about the decoded image is provided, including resolution (757x66), MIME type (image/png), extension (png), size (8.18 KB), and bit depth (8), along with a link to download the decoded image. The "Decode Base64 to Image" button triggers the conversion process and reveals the "Preview Image" section with an option to toggle the background color. 2x" data-dominant-color="EFF0E7">image1518Ã—765 95.5 KB
