I have completed 5 GAs, but missed others due to the time commitment required, along with managing three other subjects and one project. I kindly request that 5 bonus marks be awarded to all, as the additional marks for GA were not communicated earlier. This could result in a disadvantage for those of us who were unaware of the extra marks for GA7. Thank you for considering this.

Akash
