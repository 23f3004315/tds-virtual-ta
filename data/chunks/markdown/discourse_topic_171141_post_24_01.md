Would you mind reviewing the evaluation.log screenshot I have attached? I believe I may deserve marks for Task B6. @carlton, could you kindly take a look?

The system outputs that the scraped data was saved to `./data/b6.json`, and it makes a GET request to `http://localhost:8052/read?path=/data/b6.json`. The expected output is a list of author names: `['Albert Einstein', 'J.K. Rowling', 'Albert Einstein', 'Jane Austen', 'Marilyn Monroe', 'Albert Einstein', 'André Gide', 'Thomas A. Edison', 'Eleanor Roosevelt', 'Steve Martin']`. However, the result shows a JSON structure with a key ".author" containing a list of author names, including "Andr\u00e9 Gide", which indicates an encoding issue and also implies that the structure is nested unexpectedly, thus causing the test to fail.atting the author names from the scraped JSON data to match the expected output for test case B6." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="bhTEWgYwF8mPxpMmqTUo8H2BOwB" width="690" height="276" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2004912]** This image depicts a failed test case (B6) from a student's TDS project, showcasing a discrepancy between the expected output and the actual result. The test expects a flat list of author names from the JSON data in `/data/b6.json`. However, the actual result shows a JSON structure with a top-level list containing a single object; inside this object is a field named "author" that holds the list of author names. The "EXPECTED" output list contains strings like 'Albert Einstein', 'J.K. Rowling', etc., while the "RESULT" JSON shows a structure `{"author": ["Albert Einstein", "J.K. Rowling", ... ]}`. The student needs to adjust their data extraction logic to correctly format the output as a simple list of author names instead of the nested JSON structure. The 'André Gide' entry also shows a unicode escape sequence issue, indicating a potential encoding or parsing problem., **[Discussion Image by 23f2004912]** This image depicts a failed test case from a student project, specifically project B6. The system scraped data and saved it to `./data/b6.json`, confirming this with an HTTP 200 OK status. However, the test failed because the "RESULT" (the scraped data in JSON format with a key ".author") did not match the "EXPECTED" list of author names. The expected output is a simple list of strings, while the actual result is a JSON object containing a list of strings under the key "author". This indicates a discrepancy in how the data was structured during the scraping or how it was subsequently processed for comparison. The "André Gide" element in the output also displays as "Andr\u00e9 Gide", indicating a possible encoding issue, but the mismatch in data structure is the primary cause of failure. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2004912]** This image shows a student's output related to a data scraping project, specifically task B6, indicating a discrepancy between the expected result and the actual result obtained after scraping data to a file named `b6.json`. The `HTTP 200` status confirms successful scraping and saving of data. However, the expected output is a simple list of author names, while the actual output is a JSON structure containing a ".author" key which maps to a list of author names. This difference in structure causes the "B6 FAILED" error because the test expects a list but receives a JSON object containing a list. The special character `\u00e9` appears to be a unicode representation of 'é' in the name 'André Gide'. 2x" data-dominant-color="FCFCFC">image1460×585 24.9 KB
