**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image shows a table of student project submissions, likely for a TDS (Topics in Data Science) course. The columns include timestamp, email address, GitHub repository link, and DockerHub image name. The table can be filtered using a search bar at the top with the student ID "23f1001236" entered. Three submissions from the student "23f1001236@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" are displayed with different timestamps, GitHub repository links ("tds_proj.git" and "tdsrepos.git"), and corresponding DockerHub image names ("tds-proj" and "tdsrepos"). This looks like a view for instructors/TAs to review student submissions for Project 1, and Jivraj is likely highlighting some discrepancies in the data.hese discrepancies between the submissions could be the source of student confusion within the larger "Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies" discussion." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="nRxJMiuYj88WV3hfVjfdjtzAJ8o" width="690" height="115" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image shows a table displaying student submissions for a project, likely Project 1, based on data extracted from a form. The table columns include 'Timestamp', 'Email Address', 'Link to GitHub repository with code for Project 1', and 'Name of the image published on DockerHub'. A student with the email 23f1001236@ds.study.iitm.ac.in has multiple entries, with potentially different GitHub repository and DockerHub image names submitted on different dates. A search bar at the top has the value "23f1001236" entered, possibly used to filter the results by student ID. The student may have initially submitted 'tds_proj.git' and 'tds-proj' but later corrected it to 'tdsrepos.git' and 'tdsrepos'., **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image shows a table of student submissions, likely related to Project 1 in a TDS course, with a search bar at the top showing "23f1001236," which is likely the student ID being searched. The table has columns for Timestamp, Email Address, the link to the student's GitHub repository for Project 1, and the name of the image published on DockerHub. The table displays data for the email address "23f1001236@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" across three rows with different submission timestamps and repository links to either "MaheshSingh01/tds_proj.git" or "MaheshSingh01/tdsrepos.git", with corresponding DockerHub image names "maheshsingh01/tds-proj" or "maheshsingh01/tdsrepos". The varying information between the rows indicates potential discrepancies or updates to the student's project submission, which is part of a larger discussion about such inconsistencies. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image shows data likely reviewed by an instructor or teaching assistant in the TDS student discussion forum. The displayed data is a table listing student submissions for Project 1, searchable by student ID "23f1001236" in the search bar. The table columns are Timestamp, Email Address (e.g., 23f1001236@ds.study.iitm.ac.in), Github repository link (e.g., https://github.com/MaheshSingh01/tds_proj.git or https://github.com/MaheshSingh01/tdsrepos.git), and DockerHub image name (e.g., maheshsingh01/tds-proj or maheshsingh01/tdsrepos). This display confirms the instructor or TA is checking student submissions for required elements like project Github links and DockerHub image names, potentially clarifying student confusion about what information they need to submit. 2x" data-dominant-color="191E25">image1737Ã—291 23.2 KB
