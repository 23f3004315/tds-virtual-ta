# Data Discovery

---

[**[Course Image: Data discovery]** The image introduces the concept of "Data Discovery" within the broader topic of archiving, specifically focusing on the tools used in data science. Data discovery involves exploring and understanding the characteristics of available data before performing in-depth analysis or modeling. The image suggests that data discovery is a preliminary step to gain insights and stories from data. Understanding data discovery involves learning various tools to extract, analyze, and visualize data to form a clear picture of its nature and potential use. Key concepts in mastering data discovery include understanding data types, distributions, relationships, and potential biases before using it in further analysis.Science" emphasizes the initial, crucial step of exploring available datasets within an archive to understand their structure, content, and potential use for analysis. This step precedes any data processing or modeling. Data discovery involves techniques like examining metadata, sampling data, and visualizing key attributes to gain initial insights. Tools used in data science facilitate this process, allowing users to efficiently understand the data's characteristics. Mastering data discovery is essential to selecting appropriate datasets, identifying potential biases, and ensuring data quality before further analysis.)](https://youtu.be/3OeMOb7gByE)

Before we begin the data science journey, you first need the data set. And to get the
data set, you need to know where it is. This is what we will be covering in the first module.

How do you discover data? There are three things that you will learn in this module.

- The first is, what are the different sources of data sets? Where can you find them?
- The second is, what are the different kinds of data sets? Structured, unstructured and semi-structured.
- Third, in each data set, what are the different kinds of values that you will find?

This will give you a sense of locating the kind of data set that you want, either on the internet
or within your organization or even within your phones.
