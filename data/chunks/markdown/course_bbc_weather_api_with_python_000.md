## BBC Weather location ID with Python

[**[Course Image: BBC Weather location API with Python]** This image introduces the topic of accessing BBC Weather data using a location service as part of the "TOOLS IN DATA SCIENCE" course. The learning objective is to teach students how to retrieve weather data by specifying a location. Specifically, the lecture will cover how to utilize the BBC Weather location service to obtain relevant weather information using Python. The instructor for this module is Anand S, and the tutorial instructor is Mahesh Balan U. Mastering this section will enable students to integrate real-world weather data into their data science projects.of utilizing the BBC Weather location service to retrieve weather data. The material is part of the "Tools in Data Science" course, taught by instructor Anand S, with tutorial instruction provided by Mahesh Balan U. The focus is on learning how to "get the data" specifically using the BBC Weather API. This likely involves understanding how to identify the correct location IDs needed to query the API for weather information. Understanding how to obtain and utilize these location IDs is crucial for building applications that retrieve weather data from the BBC Weather service.)](https://youtu.be/IafLrvnamAw)

You'll learn how to get the location ID of any city from the BBC Weather API -- as a precursor to scraping weather data -- covering:

- **Understanding API Calls**: Learn how backend API calls work when searching for a city on the BBC weather website.
- **Inspecting Web Interactions**: Use the browser's inspect element feature to track API calls and understand the network activity.
- **Extracting Location IDs**: Identify and extract the location ID from the API response using Python.
- **Using Python Libraries**: Import and use requests, json, and urlencode libraries to make API calls and process responses.
- **Constructing API URLs**: Create structured API URLs dynamically with constant prefixes and query parameters using urlencode.
- **Building Functions**: Develop a Python function that accepts a city name, constructs the API call, and returns the location ID.
