## Post #578 by 23ds3000090

**Direct Link**: [Post #578](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/169029/578)

Could someone clarify whether the endpoint should include /api when being evaluated? I submitted it without /api and Iâ€™m wondering if it will be automatically appended or if we must include it explicitly. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
