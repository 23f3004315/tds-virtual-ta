@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj

In the Task B5, where we have to run an SQL query on a sqlite or duckdb database, should I create a database on my own and then take the query to be ran on it as an argument? Or should I take the query as an argument and run it on the ticker_sales.db in ./data folder? Please guide
