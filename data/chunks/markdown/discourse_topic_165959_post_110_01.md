**[Discussion Image by 23f2003853]** This image appears to be a vocabulary exercise or a list of Latin words, likely part of the TDS student discussion as an example or reference point, even though the connection to GA4 or data sourcing is not immediately clear. It is arranged in three columns with headings "capitulus", "deleniti", and "pariatur", followed by rows of Latin words under each heading, such as "voluptate", "barba", "bellum", and so on. The absence of error messages, code snippets, UI elements, or troubleshooting procedures suggests that this image is not related to solving a technical problem directly. Instead, it might be used metaphorically or as a tangential point within the broader discussion, perhaps highlighting the "language" of data or concepts from the course in a novel way. columns of Latin words, with the column headers "capitulus," "deleniti," and "pariatur." Each column contains a list of Latin words: The first column contains "voluptate, quaerat, vestigium, ait." The second contains "barba, cedo, trans, alioqui" and the third has "bellum, cursus, sortitus, verumtamen." This is likely a vocabulary exercise or example, possibly related to terminology used in data analysis or a general example included by an instructor." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="hRSJTku747hD4RjWmjtJy4YJJo2" width="313" height="136">image313Ã—136 5.2 KB
