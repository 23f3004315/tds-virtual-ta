 It will show up as 110 marks. Bonus marks are for all discourse posts on this thread that Anand has identified as valid. I have provided operations team with the update corrected scores. You will start seeing them in the dashboard soon. 
Also these are the list of students that have been affected by Nur-Sultan in their questions. These will get an automatic mark for that question if they attempted it. Note that this is not a bonus mark. This is a free mark.
