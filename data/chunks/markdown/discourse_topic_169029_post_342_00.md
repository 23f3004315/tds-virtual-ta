## Post #342 by Algsoch

**Direct Link**: [Post #342](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/169029/342)

Dear Sir,

I would like to clarify the situation regarding my previous submission. Initially, I provided an ngrok link, but due to an error with ngrok, it stopped working. I then found an alternative solution using Cloudflare with a custom domain that I obtained through the GitHub Student Pack. I successfully created a tunnel, and it is currently functional. I can shut down my laptop, and it still works with the same URL when I restart.

I hope you will consider my case. I submitted my work at that time because I learned about this solution from a fellow student on Discord. I only changed the URL and made no other modifications.

Thank you for your understanding
