**[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image depicts a student's question regarding the `app.py` file in the `llmagent` project within Visual Studio Code (VS Code), indicating peer discussion around discrepancies. The VS Code Explorer shows the project directory `llmagent` and its contents, including `.env`, `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `Dockerfile`, `evaluate.py`, `LICENSE`, `readme.md`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`. The `app.py` file content is displayed in the editor, containing a list of commented-out dependencies such as "requests", "fastapi", "uvicorn", "python-dateutil", "pandas", "db-sqlite3", "scipy", "pybase64", "python-dotenv", "httpx", "markdown", and "duckdb". The student seems to be focused on the list of dependencies commented out in the app.py file, potentially questioning their purpose or how to properly handle them..py`, `datagen.py`, `Dockerfile`, `evaluate.py`, `LICENSE`, `readme.md`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`. The central pane shows the contents of `app.py`, which are heavily commented out, but indicates the project's intent is to define Python dependencies. Specifically, it appears a student is looking at the commented out "dependencies" list which includes libraries like "requests", "fastapi", "uvicorn", and others. This context indicates a student question about the required dependencies for the project, specifically how to install and manage these dependencies based on the `app.py` file." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="NuYhBW6qFDhU777JjKITbgetdA" width="690" height="436" data-dominant-color="212322">image730Ã—462 21.4 KB
