**[Discussion Image by 22f3001832]** This image depicts an automated email response to a student's Project 1 submission, indicating prerequisite check failures and suggesting areas for improvement. The email lists the project prerequisites including Github repository accessibility and presence of a license file and Dockerfile. While the Docker image is confirmed to be present and public, the Github repo, Dockerfile, and MIT license are flagged as missing from the root of the Github repository. This likely indicates a configuration issue in the student's repository setup, requiring them to make the repository public and ensure that the Dockerfile and license are in the expected location for the automated checks to pass.t and public in Docker Hub. The student is likely seeking assistance because files are present but the automated check is failing." alt="Screenshot from 2025-04-01 09-01-07" data-base62-sha1="yfcO90aYRWfjsejDEFqU65TEna9" width="690" height="265" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f3001832]** This image shows a student's automated evaluation email for a TDS Project 1 submission, indicating prerequisite checks and failures. The email begins by outlining the project requirements, directing students to the TDS Project 1 Evaluation page for details. It lists key requirements like a publicly accessible GitHub repository, a LICENSE file with the MIT license, a valid Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image. The email then presents the evaluation results: while the Docker image passes the public accessibility check on Dockerhub, the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license presence checks all fail. This indicates a student's confusion where files in their local repository are not being detected correctly when the automated script runs., **[Discussion Image by 22f3001832]** This image shows an automated email response to a student's Project 1 submission, indicating failing prerequisite checks. The email begins by listing the five prerequisites for the project, directing the student to the TDS Project 1: Evaluation page for details. The evaluation results section shows that while the Docker image being present and public on Dockerhub passed, the remaining checks failed: the Github repo being present and public, the Dockerfile present in the root of the Github repo, and the MIT license present at the root of the Github repo all failed. This indicates the student is encountering issues with their GitHub repository setup. The student needs to ensure that their GitHub repository exists, is publicly accessible, contains a Dockerfile and LICENSE file in the root directory, and that the LICENSE file uses the MIT license. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f3001832]** This image shows an automated email providing feedback on Project 1 prerequisites, suggesting a potential issue with student submission and is part of a student discussion. The email lists the prerequisites for the project, including a publicly accessible GitHub repository with a LICENSE file and Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image that uses the same Dockerfile. The "Prerequisite evaluations" section indicates that the Docker image is present and public, but the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license are failing the checks. This feedback mechanism highlights that the student's GitHub repository is either not public, or the Dockerfile and LICENSE file are not present in the root of the repository which prevents the Project 1 submission from being evaluated. 2x" data-dominant-color="F5F5F5">Screenshot from 2025-04-01 09-01-071174Ã—451 54.2 KB
