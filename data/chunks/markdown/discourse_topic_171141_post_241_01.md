**[Discussion Image by 22f3000107]** This image depicts an automated email sent from the TDS Team to a learner, providing feedback on Project 1 prerequisites. The email indicates the learner failed all prerequisite checks, resulting in a project score of 0. The specific failures include: the Docker image not being present and public on Docker Hub, the GitHub repository not being present and public, the absence of a Dockerfile in the root of the GitHub repository, and the absence of an MIT license file in the root of the GitHub repository. The email also outlines the prerequisites, specifying that the GitHub repository must be publicly accessible with an MIT license, contain a valid Dockerfile, and that the Docker image must be publicly accessible and runnable via a `podman run` command, explicitly shown as: `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`, and use the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository. This automated message guides students to ensure their project meets basic criteria before further evaluation, highlighting common errors and providing clear steps for rectification.a Project 1 score of 0. The email functions as feedback, informing the student that the project will not be evaluated until the prerequisites are met, providing links to the TDS Project 1 Evaluation page for further information. The main problem highlighted is the failure to meet the minimum requirements for project evaluation." alt="Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 12.50.38 PM" data-base62-sha1="rIrFRUWhRQtmzIx5E6g379UXFYC" width="690" height="439" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f3000107]** This image shows an automated email sent by the TDS Team to a student, detailing the results of the Project 1 prerequisite evaluations. The email outlines five requirements that must be met, including having a public and accessible GitHub repository, a LICENSE file with the MIT license, a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image that can run via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`, and that the Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository. The email then reports that the student's submission failed on all counts: the Docker image is not found in Docker Hub or is not public, the GitHub repo is not found or is not public, the Dockerfile is not present in the root of the GitHub repo, and the MIT license is not present. As a result, the student's prerequisites have failed and their project score is 0., **[Discussion Image by 22f3000107]** This email is an instructor feedback on Project 1, indicating prerequisite failures. The email details five mandatory requirements for the project, including having a public GitHub repository with a LICENSE file and valid Dockerfile, and ensuring the Docker image is publicly accessible. The automated evaluation reveals that the student's Docker image isn't found on Docker Hub or is not public, the GitHub repository is not public, the Dockerfile is missing, and the MIT license is absent from the root of the GitHub repo, resulting in a failed prerequisite check and a project score of 0. The email directs the student to the TDS Project 1 Evaluation page for further clarification and lists the exact `podman run` command that the image must be compatible with. The student must correct these issues to have their project evaluated. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f3000107]** This image shows an email from the TDS Team regarding the Project 1 scores, which serves as an instructor communication to a student. The email details the project's prerequisites, including having a public and accessible GitHub repository, a LICENSE file with the MIT license, a valid Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image runnable via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`. The email indicates that the student's submission failed all prerequisite checks, specifically that the Docker image isn't public on Docker Hub, the GitHub repo isn't public, the Dockerfile is missing from the repo's root, and the MIT license is absent. As a result of failing the prerequisites, the student's project score is 0. The email is providing a clear list of requirements and showing where the student failed to meet them. 2x" data-dominant-color="F8F8F8">Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 12.50.38 PM2062Ã—1314 262 KB
