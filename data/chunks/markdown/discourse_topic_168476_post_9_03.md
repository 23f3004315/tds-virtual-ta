 will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).

Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble.
Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.
Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - *Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them* The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.
@22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.
