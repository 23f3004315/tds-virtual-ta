**[Discussion Image by 23f2000573]** This image depicts a student question within a discussion thread about deployment tools, specifically concerning Docker image URLs. The student is attempting to input the Docker image URL, following the specified format of `https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general`, and enters `https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/23f2000573/first-rep/general`. However, the system returns an error message: "Error: 23f2000573 is not one of the tags in https://hub.docker.com/v2/namespaces/23f2000573/repositories/first-rep/tags," indicating a problem with the Docker image tag or repository name. The student is likely confused about how to correctly format or identify the Docker image URL, as the error suggests the entered tag is invalid in the specified repository. The "Check" button implies the student is validating their input against a system.e tag or version is incorrect or not available in the repository, pointing to a possible misunderstanding of Docker image tagging conventions. The student needs to ensure the tag '23f2000573' actually exists within their Docker Hub repository under 'first-rep'." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="7Msdp9SfDmW9eEezqboTdLwT5wo" width="690" height="154" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2000573]** This image depicts a student asking about the correct Docker image URL format, showing their attempt: `https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/23f2000573/first-rep/general`. The system responds with an error: "23f2000573 is not one of the tags in https://hub.docker.com/v2/namespaces/23f2000573/repositories/first-rep/tags". This indicates the student's Docker image URL is incorrect because the specified tag `23f2000573` is not a valid tag for the `first-rep` repository within the student's Docker Hub namespace. The correct URL should use a valid tag that exists in the specified repository, instead of treating the username as a tag. The "Check" button implies this is part of an interactive exercise that validates the input URL., **[Discussion Image by 23f2000573]** This image depicts a student question in the TDS "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion thread regarding the correct format for a Docker image URL. The student, 23f2000573, provides a URL "https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/23f2000573/first-rep/general" as their answer, which is highlighted with a red border to indicate it's being evaluated. The system responds with the error message: "Error: 23f2000573 is not one of the tags in https://hub.docker.com/v2/namespaces/23f2000573/repositories/first-rep/tags", suggesting that the provided username/repository combination does not exist or the specified tag ('23f2000573') is invalid. The expected URL format is given as: "https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general," likely indicating the student needs to replace $USER and $REPO with appropriate values. The "Check" button implies an interactive assessment where the student is submitting their answer for verification. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2000573]** This image shows a student question in the TDS "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion thread related to Docker image URL configuration. The student provides a URL: `https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/23f2000573/first-rep/general` in a red-outlined input field, aiming to match the format `https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general`. However, upon clicking a "Check" button, an error message appears: "Error: 23f2000573 is not one of the tags in https://hub.docker.com/v2/namespaces/23f2000573/repositories/first-rep/tags". This suggests the student's provided Docker Hub username may not match an existing tag in the specified repository ("first-rep"). The student seems to be struggling with correctly formatting the Docker image URL or understanding the necessary tagging conventions. 2x" data-dominant-color="2F2E33">image1730Ã—387 32.5 KB
