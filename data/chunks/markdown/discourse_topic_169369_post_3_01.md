Dear Sir,

I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the ROE multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent.

I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing this issue

**[Discussion Image by 23f3004246]** This image depicts a student's dashboard showing their "Recent saves" for a programming quiz, where the most recent save is labeled as their official score. The screenshot displays the user logged in as "23f3004246@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" with a "Logout" button. The "Recent saves" section shows a list of submissions with corresponding timestamps and scores: "from 3/2/2025, 1:44:11 PM. Score: 6," "from 3/2/2025, 1:41:44 PM. Score: 5," and "from 3/2/2025, 1:38:33 PM. Score: 4", each with a corresponding "Reload" button. This indicates that the student made multiple attempts at the quiz, with the most recent submission resulting in a score of 6. The student seems to be checking the dashboard to confirm their score for the programming quiz.reenshot shows the user is logged in as "23f3004246@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." with a "Logout" button visible. The "Recent saves" section displays a list of quiz attempts, each showing a "Reload" button, the date and time of the attempt (3/2/2025), and the corresponding "Score". The accompanying text clarifies that the "most recent is your official score." In this case, there are three saved attempts with scores of 4, 5, and 6, suggesting incremental improvements over time. This information helps the student track their progress and confirms their official score." alt="Screenshot 2025-03-07 212639" data-base62-sha1="9KHlLS5EES5uYQVjaDGnaIgke7K" width="524" height="386">Screenshot 2025-03-07 212639524Ã—386 47.4 KB
