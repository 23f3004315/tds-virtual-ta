Should it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block

It will be just answer.

Some questions have more than one file. For example, the last question of GA5, it has a png file in this link **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image, posted by Jivraj in thread "Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread", shows a collection of futuristic cityscape images. Each image contains elements like neon-lit skyscrapers, elevated highways with fast-moving vehicles, and flying vehicles, all contributing to a science fiction theme. The images seem to have been generated by an AI model or image processing software. Without the original question, it is difficult to tell the purpose of this image in the discussion. It could be illustrative, inspirational, or for discussion of visual aspects of the project. and a table.

In this case, how will the curl request be? Is it some thing like this

`curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
 -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
 -F "question=question text" \
 -F "file= Image file" \
 -F "file= table file/ string" 
`

In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2.

Will the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different?
