**[Discussion Image by 22f2000113]** This image shows a student's attempt to create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok, as part of the "GA2 - Deployment Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]". The student has downloaded the Llamafile and is trying to run the `Llama-3.2-18-Instruct.06 K.llamafile` model with it, following the instructions. However, when providing the ngrok URL `https://02f4-2402-e280-3e32-27f-4b0-6f91-4275-52f3.ngrok-free.app`, an error is encountered: "Error: Response is not valid JSON: error code: 524", indicating a problem with the server's response format. This suggests the student is seeking assistance in resolving the JSON parsing error related to ngrok. The URL provided seems to be causing an issue and may be due to network connectivity problems or improper configuration.e" data-base62-sha1="rtagAvUZn7oH2JFSaFflFfhm0w8" width="690" height="180" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f2000113]** This image shows a student during a deployment exercise who is encountering an error after setting up an ngrok tunnel for a Llamafile server. The student is prompted to find the ngrok URL, which is expected to be in the format `https://[random].ngrok-free.app/`. The student provides a generated ngrok URL `https://02f4-2402-e280-3e32-27f-4b0-6f91-4275-52f3.ngrok-free.app` in the discussion thread, but receives an error message: "Error: Response is not valid JSON: error code: 524". This indicates a problem with the server's response, suggesting a potential issue with the Llamafile server setup or the ngrok tunnel configuration, and possibly that the server is returning a non-JSON response, which is unexpected. This constitutes a troubleshooting scenario requiring assistance from instructors or peers to resolve the deployment issue., **[Discussion Image by 22f2000113]** This image captures a student's attempt to retrieve the ngrok URL for a Llamafile server tunnel during a deployment tools assignment in the TDS Jan 2025 course. The student followed the instructions to download and run the `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6 K.llamafile` model and create a tunnel using ngrok, then they entered the ngrok URL `https://02f4-2402-e280-3e32-27f-4b0-6f91-4275-52f3.ngrok-free.app` as requested. However, the student encountered an error message: "Error: Response is not valid JSON: error code: 524", indicating a problem with the server's response format or a potential server-side issue. This is likely a student question regarding how to resolve this error, as it stops them from continuing the assignment. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f2000113]** This image depicts a student question regarding the use of `ngrok` for creating a tunnel to a `Llamafile` server, specifically while running the `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6 K.llamafile` model. The student is trying to determine the correct `ngrok` URL format, expecting something like `https://[random].ngrok-free.app/`. However, upon entering the `ngrok` URL that was generated (`https://02f4-2402-e280-3e32-27f-4b0-6f91-4275-52f3.ngrok-free.app`), they receive an error message stating: "Error: Response is not valid JSON: error code: 524". This indicates a potential issue with the server's response or data format that the client is expecting, specifically in JSON format, and the error code suggests a possible timeout or gateway issue during communication. This screenshot shows the error that a student encountered when trying to access their `ngrok` URL, preventing them from properly deploying the model. 2x" data-dominant-color="FAF8FA">image1348Ã—352 21.4 KB
