The same issue is happening in the question 12 of GA1. I have given the answer by using collab and gemini , its giving the proper result but showing wrong.

**[Discussion Image by roy2003]** This image captures a student's Python script for processing CSV and TXT files, likely part of a TDS "Development Tools" assignment focusing on file handling and data extraction. The script reads data from three files, combines their content, splits it into lines, parses each line into symbol and value pairs, and then sums the values associated with specified symbols; it uses `chardet.detect()` to handle different file encodings and includes error handling (`FileNotFoundError`, `UnicodeDecodeError`, `IndexError`, `ValueError`). The student seems to have successfully executed the script, with the output "The sum of all values associated with the specified symbols is: 31532.0" displayed in the console. Alongside the code is a thumbnail for a "Computer Stuff They Didn't Teach You" YouTube video about "Code Pages, Character Encoding, Unicode, UTF-8 and the BOM," suggesting the student is researching character encoding issues to improve their code's robustness. The script reads the paths for the three files from user input: "Enter the path to the first CSV file:", "Enter the path to the second CSV file:", and "Enter the path to the TXT file:".eError`. The output shows the final sum printed as "The sum of all values associated with the specified symbols is: 31512.0", indicating successful execution and suggesting that the student is addressing encoding issues and data processing for the assignment." alt="Minimal Square Photo Collage Photography Instagram Post" data-base62-sha1="tDP9Wu8L7VQ6XIlXwhfURiPdD7Y" width="500" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by roy2003]** The image shows a student's Python code for processing CSV and TXT files, alongside a video titled "COMPUTER STUFF THEY DIDN'T TEACH YOU: Code Pages, Character Encoding, Unicode, UTF-8 and the BOM". The Python code reads the files, combines their content, splits them into lines, extracts symbol-value pairs, and calculates the total sum of values associated with specific symbols; it also includes error handling for file not found and encoding issues, using `chardet` to detect file encodings. The script prompts the user for the file paths and then prints the sum of the values, which, according to the output in the console, is 31512.0. The video on the right provides learning guidance on character encoding, which is crucial for correctly reading and processing the input files, resolving potential student confusion related to file encoding errors. The code uses try-except blocks to handle potential `IndexError` and `ValueError` exceptions that may arise due to incorrect formatting or non-numeric values, preventing the script from crashing., **[Discussion Image by roy2003]** This image shows a student's Python code and execution attempting to solve a data processing task, coupled with a video about character encoding. The Python script reads three files (two CSVs and one TXT), detects their encodings using the `chardet` library, and sums the numerical values associated with specific symbols ('$', '£', '€') found in the files. Error handling is implemented for file not found and Unicode decoding issues using `try...except` blocks. The student inputs the file paths, and the code outputs a sum of 31512.0, which is indicated in the lower right as an incorrect answer to the problem described in the video about encoding. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by roy2003]** The image shows a student's Python code implementation for reading and processing three files (data1.csv, data2.csv, data3.txt) as part of a TDS assignment, and a related video being watched. The code reads each file in binary mode to detect encoding using `chardet`, then re-reads the file with the detected encoding to handle potential encoding issues using `try...except` blocks for `FileNotFoundError` and `UnicodeDecodeError`. The code then concatenates the content of the files, splits it into lines, iterates through each line to extract symbol and value, and sums values associated with specific symbols, handling potential errors such as `IndexError` and `ValueError` during conversion. The final computed sum 31512.0 which the student has typed into a text box. The related video titled "Code Pages, Character Encoding, Unicode, UTF-8 and the BOM" is viewed to learn the concepts necessary to handle encoding correctly. 2x" data-dominant-color="515252">Minimal Square Photo Collage Photography Instagram Post1080×1080 126 KB
