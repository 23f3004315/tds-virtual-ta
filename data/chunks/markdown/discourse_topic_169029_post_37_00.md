## Post #37 by Algsoch

I just want to know if you prefer using an existing language model application where we utilize an LLM (Large Language Model), train it, and format the output. For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs.

Alternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I’m curious about your preference.

Additionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code.

Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that’s where you’ll spend most of your time, so make sure you’re comfortable with it.

Visual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you’ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial.

To get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs:
