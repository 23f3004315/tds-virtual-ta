We had a session on 28th Jan introducing all the important aspects of Project.

If you do not do everything exactly as mentioned **especially the pre - requisites** mentioned in the Evaluation section you will get 0 in the project and *there will be no appeal* for failing to meet the pre - requisites of the evaluation criteria.

In order for us to evaluate the project you have to provide the deliverables mentioned above.

Kind regards
