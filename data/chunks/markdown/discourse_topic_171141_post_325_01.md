**[Discussion Image by 23f2004644]** This image shows a student's terminal output during the TDS project, indicating a debugging scenario. The "C5 failed: Cannot read /data/c5.txt" error and the "HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND" message suggest a file path issue when the program tries to access a data file. The student's score is 11/25, implying a partially successful execution, and a successful POST request to the OpenAI embeddings endpoint indicates some functionality is working. The Visual Studio Code interface displays a prompt to install the recommended 'Python' extension, which might help with debugging or code analysis. The current working directory is shown as `/workspaces/Large-Language-Model`. It looks like the student is having trouble with accessing the necessary data file for the project." and the overall issue appears to be related to file path resolution in accessing local data." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="9wvbcrQ9VPMr8UroyhLEhM16ria" width="690" height="170" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2004644]** This image shows a student's terminal output and a VS Code notification, indicating a student question regarding project execution. The terminal output shows an HTTP 404 error when trying to GET `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt`, leading to a "C5 failed: Cannot read /data/c5.txt" error, and consequently, a low score of 11/25. Additionally, the student receives an HTTP 200 OK response from a POST request to an OpenAI embeddings endpoint. The VS Code notification asks if the student wants to install the recommended Python extension from Microsoft, suggesting a potentially missing or incomplete Python development environment setup. The error indicates that the server running locally cannot find the requested data file, `c5.txt`, in the specified directory., **[Discussion Image by 23f2004644]** This image captures a student's terminal output and a VS Code popup within a TDS project discussion. The terminal shows an HTTP 404 error when trying to GET the file `/data/c5.txt`, indicating a file not found issue, alongside a failed C5 test and a score of 11/25. A subsequent HTTP POST request to `aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev` appears successful, returning an HTTP 200 OK. The VS Code popup is prompting the user to install the recommended Python extension from Microsoft, offering "Install" and "Show Recommendations" options. The student is likely encountering an issue related to file pathing or file existence, preventing the successful completion of the C5 test, and the IDE is suggesting an extension that could aid in Python development. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2004644]** This image depicts a student encountering an error while running a local HTTP server for a project, specifically the server failing to read the file `/data/c5.txt`, resulting in a "404 NOT FOUND" error and a failed test case ("C5 failed"). The image shows the terminal output indicating this error, as well as a subsequent successful POST request to the OpenAI embeddings API. Additionally, the screenshot includes a pop-up prompt from VS Code, asking the user if they want to install the recommended Python extension from Microsoft. The student appears to be working in the "/workspaces/Large-Language-Model" directory, and the project currently has a score of 11/25. The root cause appears to be the server's inability to locate the required data file 'c5.txt'. 2x" data-dominant-color="D1CFD3">image1380Ã—341 63.6 KB
