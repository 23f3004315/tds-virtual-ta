[Quote]: 
The data file sent to the api will always be in the **requesterâ€™s** local machine. When the api server receives the request, the file will be in binary format?

Or

Sometimes the api server receives the file in byte and some times, it will recieve a link like this : **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image depicts the intended output for the TDS Solver project, showcasing a visual representation of the shapes and the reference line. A red square and a green circle are positioned at the top of the image, above a horizontal blue line. A yellow triangle sits below the blue line, closer to the bottom edge. The black background provides contrast to the shapes and line, making them easily visible. This visual aid is intended to guide students in verifying the correctness of their solver implementations.

file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA.
