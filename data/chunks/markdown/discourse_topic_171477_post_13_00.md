## Post #13 by Jivraj

URGENT ATTN REQ: technical discrepancy and inconsistency in the evaluation scripts of graded assignment and project 2 Tools in Data Science
 
 [Quote]: 
 Project 1 : You tried to copy parent folder(Ref:line number 8 in your Dockerfile) but there is no parent folder with respect to github repoâ€™s root folder, so it fails evaluation. 
Project 2 : Response we received through google form was http://127.0.0.1:8000/api which is local host url not a vercel endpoint.
