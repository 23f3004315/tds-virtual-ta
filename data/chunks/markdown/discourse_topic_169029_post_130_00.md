## Post #130 by 21f2000709

If there is any plan for extension, I request the TDS team to announce it in advance as people would rush and submit, then, they come hear about the extension when they had submitted it already.

Happened to me like almost every time. We have OPPE this weekend, so if there is slightest possibility, I request to announce it in advance.

Thanks
