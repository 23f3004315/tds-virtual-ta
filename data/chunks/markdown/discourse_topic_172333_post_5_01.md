**[Discussion Image by 22f3001307]** This image portrays a student engaging with a practice exam on the quizpractice.space website, specifically an IITM Diploma AN2 EXAM QPD2 for the subject CT (Computer Technology). The student is currently on Question 3, which is a matching question involving logical and arithmetic expressions in C. The student has 9 seconds remaining, with controls available to pause, restart, and submit the exam. The interface shows a "Question Menu" with buttons numbered 1-18, likely for navigating between questions. The question asks to match expressions like `2 == 2 or 2 > 3` with options such as "Invalid expression," "True," "False," "4," and "'22'". Five multiple-choice options are displayed, each mapping letters a through e to the provided result values.hows an active timer counting down from 9 seconds, controls to pause/resume and reset the timer, and a "Submit Exam" button. Question 3 is displayed, presenting a matching question where expressions on the left side (e.g., "2 == 2 or 2 > 3") must be matched with their corresponding values or descriptions on the right (e.g., "Invalid expression," "True," "False," "4," "22"). A list of multiple-choice options is shown, each assigning matches between the left-side expressions (a, b, c, d, e) and right-side options (1-5). Question menu at the left helps in navigating from question 1 to 18." class="thumbnail" data-dominant-color="6F7379" width="690" height="362">
