 A10 as well. So effectively, my A9 and A10 did not get evaluated properly as it did not have the required files due to error during data generation for A8. Can you please re-evaluate by enclosing each of the data generation function calls in their own try-except blocks?

**[Discussion Image by 22f3000819]** This image shows a code snippet, presumably Python, displaying a series of function calls. These functions are named sequentially from `a2_format_markdown()` to `a10_ticket_sales()`, suggesting they represent different tasks or modules within a larger project. The functions' naming convention (e.g., "a2", "a3", etc.) implies an ordered sequence or a categorized structure for these operations. It is likely part of an assignment where students need to implement or use these functions. This code may clarify the intended structure and workflow for a TDS project, potentially addressing student concerns about the assignment's requirements. Without further context, it is hard to say if this a student question, instructor answer, or peer discussion.()`, `a5_logs()`, `a6_docs()`, `a7_email()`, `a8_credit_card_image()`, `a9_comments()`, and `a10_ticket_sales()`. This suggests a Python project where students are potentially implementing functions related to data extraction, formatting, and processing of various types of information such as dates, contact details, logs, documentation, emails, credit card images, comments, and ticket sales data. The naming convention hints that these might be components or steps of a larger assignment or task. This code snippet likely illustrates the expected functionality of a particular module or file within the project." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="eQVQww2TLZd4V84EezSUFxCArFA" width="302" height="252">image302Ã—252 3.45 KB
