I think the idea behind this font is to make it difficult for people to manually work on the markdown file from scratch. I guess they want us to use the tools (like PyMuPDF4LLM, markitdown) they provided as resources to convert pdf into a markdown and then may be we can do some manual intervention to make it to the result as the scraping tools are not 100% accurate.

Could be another reason too. TAsâ€™ can feel free to pitch in.
