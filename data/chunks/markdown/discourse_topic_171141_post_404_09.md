**[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image shows a student's Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment during a TDS project, specifically related to building a Docker image. It's part of a peer discussion. On the left side is the file explorer showing the project directory "llmagent" containing files like 'app.py', 'Dockerfile', 'evaluate.py', etc. The 'app.py' file is open, displaying Python code with a "dependencies" list including packages like "requests", "fastapi", and "uvicorn". At the bottom, the terminal displays the output of the `docker build -t llm-agent .` command, showing the successful build process with several steps cached, and ultimately naming the image "docker.io/library/llm-agent". The output indicates successful image building and naming, addressing the initial discrepancies students faced.cess completes without errors, indicating a successful build, but the student posted the image within a larger discussion thread about discrepancies, so the success state may be a follow-up to resolve earlier build problems." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="nG2OeUgbHUGz9z7CBwVf90BsE1w" width="690" height="378" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image depicts a student's successful execution of a Docker build process in Visual Studio Code for the "llmagent" project, indicating a peer discussion context where the student shares their successful build. The VS Code Explorer shows project files like `app.py`, `Dockerfile`, and `.env`, while the `app.py` file open in the editor reveals Python dependencies such as `requests`, `fastapi`, and `uvicorn`. The terminal output demonstrates the steps involved in building the Docker image using the command `docker build -t llm-agent .`, including loading the build definition, transferring context, pulling base images, running commands, and exporting layers. The build completes without errors, culminating in the creation of a Docker image named `docker.io/library/llm-agent`, which suggests the student is resolving a build issue or confirming a correct setup. The student can view build details in Docker Desktop using the provided link., **[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image depicts a student's attempt to build a Docker image within a VS Code environment, showcasing the build process and configuration files. The file explorer shows the project structure containing `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `Dockerfile`, `evaluate.py`, `LICENSE`, `readme.md`, and `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py` along with a `.env` folder, indicating a Python project. The `app.py` file is opened showing dependency declarations like "requests", "fastapi", "uvicorn", etc. The terminal displays the output of the `docker build -t llm-agent .` command, showing the various steps involved such as loading build definition, transferring Dockerfile, loading metadata, and running commands defined in the Dockerfile (e.g., apt-get update, installing uv-installer, copying files). The build completes successfully, writing and naming the image as `docker.io/library/llm-agent`. The student is following Docker build procedures, and the output suggests a properly configured Dockerfile leading to a successful image creation. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image shows the output of a `docker build` command run in the terminal within VS Code, indicating a peer discussion or student question about Docker build issues. The command `docker build -t llm-agent .` is being used to build a Docker image tagged as `llm-agent`. The output displays a successful build process, including loading the Dockerfile, downloading base images (`python:3.12-slim-bookworm`), adding the uv installer script, and caching several steps. It also copies Python scripts and the `.env` file into the container and exports the image, with the final line showing the image is named `docker.io/library/llm-agent`. The file explorer on the left shows the project structure with files like `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `Dockerfile`, and `.env`. 2x" data-dominant-color="1C1F20">image1805Ã—989 79.9 KB
