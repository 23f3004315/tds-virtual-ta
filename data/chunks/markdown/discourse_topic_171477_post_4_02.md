**[Discussion Image by 23f2000345]** This image is an email sent to a student evaluating their submission for TDS Project 1 and indicates a problem. The email lists prerequisite checks, including the GitHub repository's existence, a LICENSE file, a valid Dockerfile, Docker image accessibility via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`, and Dockerfile consistency. The evaluation results show that while the Docker image is present in Docker Hub and public, the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license are reported as missing, resulting in a failing grade for the prerequisites and a project score of 0. The student is likely confused as the files might be present but not recognized by the evaluation script due to naming issues or location within the repository.cks, resulting in a failed prerequisite status and a project score of 0. The student is directed to the TDS Project 1 Evaluation page for further details." alt="Second Evaluation Email" data-base62-sha1="wRIr95Iz3CVtTmvWFTHHfe44dyu" width="690" height="376" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2000345]** This image is an email sent to a student, likely from the course staff, evaluating their Project 1 submission in the TDS course. The email details prerequisite checks for the project, including the existence and accessibility of the GitHub repository, the presence of a LICENSE file (MIT license), and a valid Dockerfile in the repository. It also assesses if the Docker image is publicly accessible, runs correctly using a `podman run` command (`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`), and if it utilizes the same Dockerfile as the repository. The student's submission failed on GitHub repo visibility, Dockerfile presence and MIT license presence, resulting in a "FAIL" for prerequisites and a Project 1 score of 0, meaning it will not be evaluated further., **[Discussion Image by 23f2000345]** This image depicts an automated email sent to a student regarding their Project 1 score and prerequisite evaluations for a TDS (presumably a course) assignment. The email indicates that while the Docker image is present in Docker Hub and is public, the Github repository, Dockerfile, and MIT License are reported as missing from the root of the Github repository, causing the prerequisites to fail and the project score to be 0. The email also links to the "TDS Project 1: Evaluation" page for more detailed checks and lists the specific requirements for the project, including repository accessibility, the presence of an MIT license, and a valid Dockerfile, as well as how the Docker image should run using `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`. The student is likely confused as they believe these files are present, initiating the discussion thread to address this discrepancy and seek clarification. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2000345]** This image shows an automated email, likely sent by a course grading system, to a student regarding their Project 1 submission for the "TDS Jan 25" course. The email indicates that the student failed several prerequisite checks, resulting in a project score of 0. It specifically states that the GitHub repository, the Dockerfile, and the MIT license are not present in the root of the GitHub repository, despite the Docker image being present and public on Docker Hub. The email also includes links to the "TDS Project 1: Evaluation page" and mentions the command `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`, which students need to ensure their Docker images can run through. 2x" data-dominant-color="F8F8F8">Second Evaluation Email1247×681 37.5 KB
