The error indicates that the provided ngrok tunnel is not found, likely due to an issue with the ngrok setup or the tunnel not being active or available.

A console output is visible showing a request to "https://103-76-42-164.ngrok.free.app" and a lengthy JSON response, suggesting the student is attempting to access or manipulate quiz data via a reverse-engineered API. This likely represents a student's attempt to exploit the quiz and possibly constitutes a peer discussion around hacking the quiz, as mentioned in the instructions., **[Discussion Image by roy2003]** The image shows a student's attempt to answer a question about the ngrok URL within a TDS assignment (GA2). The assignment instructions are visible at the top, along with save/check buttons and recent save history. The student is instructed to download `Llamafile`, run a specific model with it, and then create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using `ngrok`. The student enters an `ngrok` URL (https://0ed0-103-76-82-164.ngrok-free.app), which returns an "Error: Response is not valid JSON" and displays HTML code, indicating a potential issue with the ngrok tunnel configuration or the URL provided. The HTML source further suggests that the ngrok URL was not found or is invalid. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by roy2003]** The image shows a student engaging with an online quiz that instructs students to download a Llamafile and run the Llama-3.2-18-Instruct.06.K.llamafile model, then create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok, and enter the ngrok URL. The student inputs the URL `https://0ed0-103-76-82-164.ngrok-free.app`, but receives an error stating "Error: Response is not valid JSON: ..." followed by HTML code. The error indicates that the tunnel is either not correctly established or that the provided ngrok URL is not serving valid JSON data as expected by the quiz application, further evidenced by "Tunnel 0ed0-103-76-82-164.ngrok-free.app not found (ERR_NGROK_3200)".
