**[Discussion Image by Yogesh1]** This image, posted by a student named Yogesh1, depicts a UI view within the "Tools in Data Science" course on Coursera, specifically from the "REPEAT FULL COURSE" offering. It displays that the student received a grade of 72.50 for the "Week 1 Assignment." The image acts as supporting documentation to a student question about why their submission isn't visible, despite receiving a grade. The student seems to be seeking clarification or troubleshooting steps regarding the visibility of their assignment submission alongside its grade. The context points toward a potential bug or UI display issue within the Coursera platform where the submission is not displayed to the student.AT FULL COURSE," suggesting the student may be retaking the course. Below the banner, it displays "Week 1 Assignment - 72.50," indicating that the student has received a grade of 72.50 on their Week 1 assignment. This screenshot provides context to the student's question about why their submission isn't showing, although it does display the graded assignment. This suggests a possible UI issue where the submission details are not visible despite the grade being recorded." alt="Capture2" data-base62-sha1="bgT81mwXfQjqgfwWFOQivllvQHh" width="446" height="240">Capture2446×240 12.6 KB
