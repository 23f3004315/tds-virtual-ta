I received this mail from TDS Google Group Announcement this morning at 10:30 am. The Project 2 submission date mentioned in the mail i.e. 15 March 2025 contradicts with submission date mentioned in Tools in Data Science and

Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread i.e. 31 March 2025. Please clarify.
