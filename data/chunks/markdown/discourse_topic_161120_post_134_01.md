**[Discussion Image by 23f3004114]** This image captures a student's debugging process, likely during the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" assignment, and shows a side-by-side JSON comparison using jsondiff.com. The student is comparing two JSON outputs, each containing a list of objects with "class" and "studentId" keys; the difference between the files is probably related to an error. The left side and the right side have a similar structure, listing several class and student ID combinations indicating the student might be comparing the expected output with the actual output of their deployed application. The student is using this visual comparison to identify discrepancies in their data, likely to track down a bug in their code or deployment configuration. This comparison is visible across multiple tabs including localhost:8000/api, 127.0.0.1:8000/api, Docker Hub, and the assignment.derstanding of deployment and data comparison tools. By visually comparing the JSON structures, the student can verify the successful deployment or transformation of their data." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-01 at 6.15.03 PM" data-base62-sha1="2gtDpa2BPRxxDDWpJkSODYQOgn1" width="690" height="431" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f3004114]** The image depicts a student's troubleshooting process during the TDS Jan 2025 "GA2 - Deployment Tools" assignment, likely showing peer discussion. The student is using jsondiff.com to compare two JSON outputs, possibly related to API responses or data validation. Each JSON shows an array of objects with "class" and "studentId" keys. The student is likely debugging inconsistencies or errors in their deployment by comparing the expected and actual JSON outputs using a diff tool. This helps to isolate the root cause of issues by identifying the specific data discrepancies., **[Discussion Image by 23f3004114]** This image shows a student's view of JSON diff output, likely during a peer discussion within the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" thread. The student is using jsondiff.com to compare two JSON files, both containing a list of objects. Each object has a "class" and a "studentId" field, such as `{"class": "IN", "studentId": 60}`. The presence of "localhost:8000/api" and "127.0.0.1:8000/api?" in the browser tabs suggests the student is comparing the output from a local API endpoint, potentially troubleshooting data discrepancies or validating API responses during the deployment assignment. The absence of explicit questions implies the student is likely sharing results, seeking confirmation, or visually debugging the output from their deployed application using this comparison tool. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f3004114]** This image captures a student's attempt to debug an issue in their GA2 deployment. It appears the student is comparing JSON outputs, likely from two different versions or environments of their application, using a JSON diff tool hosted on jsondiff.com. The data structures being compared contain a series of JSON objects, each with "class" and "studentId" keys; the list on the left and the list on the right seem identical. The student is probably trying to identify discrepancies in the JSON data to understand why their application isn't behaving as expected after deployment, potentially due to data inconsistencies or incorrect configurations. The URLs visible in the browser tabs suggest the student is working with `localhost:8000/api` and `127.0.0.1:8000/api`, indicating they are likely testing an API endpoint. 2x" data-dominant-color="FCFBFA">Screenshot 2025-02-01 at 6.15.03 PM1920Ã—1200 77.8 KB
