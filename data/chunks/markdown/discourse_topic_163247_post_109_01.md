**[Discussion Image by Khushii]** This image depicts a student assessment question within the TDS (Tools in Data Science) Jan 2025 GA3-Large course, specifically focusing on Large Language Models. The prompt outlines a service flow involving request payloads with docs and query, embedding generation using 'text-embedding-3-small', similarity computation using cosine similarity, and a structured JSON response with matches. The assessment requires the student to provide the correct API URL endpoint for the implementation, with a hint provided in the format 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity'. The student has correctly entered 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity', which is marked as "Correct" with a green checkmark, and the system will then send a POST request to that URL to further evaluate the solution. The prompt also reminds the student to enable CORS allowing OPTIONS and POST methods.n. The assignment setup also indicates that CORS should be enabled for OPTIONS and POST methods." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-05 at 7.44.03 PM" data-base62-sha1="vtUbgBlNpgVn0DDNtE0x7pWco5x" width="690" height="448" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Khushii]** This image captures a student answering a question in the TDS 2025 Jan GA3 - Large Language Models discussion thread. The assignment details a service flow involving request payloads, embedding generation using `text-embedding-3-small`, similarity computation via cosine similarity, and a JSON response structure showing matched document contents. The student is prompted to provide the API URL endpoint for their implementation, with a hint given as `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`. The student's provided answer, `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`, is marked as "Correct". The system informs the student that it will check the implementation by sending a POST request with a JSON body containing random docs and query., **[Discussion Image by Khushii]** This image depicts a student assignment question with an instructor providing context in the TDS Jan 2025 course discussion thread. The student is asked to identify the API URL endpoint for a service implementation; the instructor offers a hint in the prompt: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`. The student successfully inputs the correct URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`, as indicated by the "Correct" message and checkmark next to the answer field. The instructor provides a detailed explanation of the service flow, including the request payload (docs array, query string), embedding generation using `text-embedding-3-small`, similarity computation (cosine similarity), and the response structure. The instructor also emphasizes the importance of enabling CORS to allow OPTIONS and POST methods. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Khushii]** This image depicts a student taking a graded assessment ("GA3 - Large Language Models") on the TDS (Tools in Data Science) platform. It presents the service flow of an API, detailing how a POST request with a JSON body containing documents and a query is processed to determine the most similar documents using text embeddings and cosine similarity. The assessment question asks for the API URL endpoint, to which the student has correctly responded with "http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity," which is validated as "Correct" by the system. The instructional text also reminds the student to enable CORS for OPTIONS and POST methods, and mentions that the endpoint will be checked with a POST request containing random docs and a query, indicating an automated testing procedure. 2x" data-dominant-color="252E2F">Screenshot 2025-02-05 at 7.44.03 PM1920Ã—1249 130 KB
