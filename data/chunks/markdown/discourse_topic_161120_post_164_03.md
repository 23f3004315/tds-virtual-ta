**[Discussion Image by 22f3000657]** This image depicts a JSON response displayed in a web browser, likely from an API endpoint, which shows data related to students and their classes. The response is formatted as a JSON array named "students," where each element is an object containing "studentId" and "class" key-value pairs. The URL visible in the address bar is `127.0.0.1:8000/api`, indicating a local development server is being used to serve the API. This is from a discussion thread about Deployment Tools in TDS, this image is very likely displaying the expected output of a deployed backend, thus represents an instructor answer or confirmation of a correct deployment.nts" array, where each element in the array is a JSON object representing a student with "studentId" and "class" properties. It shows a long listing of students, each assigned to a certain class represented by a string, such as "10O", "7K", "2G" and so on, for 252 students. This suggests a student is inspecting the data returned by the API, likely to verify the correctness of the data or to understand how the API functions. The displayed data seems to be the raw output of the API without any formatting, but with a "Pretty-print" option selected in the browser, making it more readable." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="qQGfEeN5DDl7cAPTXuEeRJHpbXR" width="690" height="351" data-dominant-color="333333">image1917Ã—976 180 KB
