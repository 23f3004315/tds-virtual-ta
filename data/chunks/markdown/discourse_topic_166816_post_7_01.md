A "Go to Course page >" button is visible at the bottom, presumably to navigate to the full course content for further details on assignments or grading. The dashboard also displays "Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) till this term" and "Project Cumulative Grade Point Average (Project," cut-off due to image size." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-12 151022" data-base62-sha1="3CBKqzRo17TPmrDYobA9pNFU6pp" width="358" height="500" data-dominant-color="AF9C9C">Screenshot 2025-02-12 151022427×596 28.1 KB
