**[Discussion Image by 21f2000588]** This image depicts a student's Github repository for the TDS GA4 project, specifically the `daily-commit.yml` workflow file. The file contains the YAML configuration for a GitHub Action that runs daily at 00:00 UTC, allowing manual triggers. The action includes steps to checkout the repository, set up Git configuration using `git config` for user email and name, and create a file named `daily-commit.txt` with a simple message. The screenshot illustrates a peer discussion focused on troubleshooting and sharing workflow code. The navigation path is `TDS_GA_4/.github/workflows/daily-commit.yml`. code editor with the YAML file open on the right." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="eNjxdZJe9atOUa4dutTWMjif63P" width="690" height="317" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 21f2000588]** This image shows a snippet of code from the "daily-commit.yml" file in the ".github/workflows" directory of a student's TDS_GA_4 repository on GitHub. The YAML file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "Daily Commit" that runs daily at 00:00 UTC. The workflow is configured to use Ubuntu as the runner, sets up Git configuration using the student's email and "GitHub Actions" as the name, and creates a file named "daily-commit.txt" with the content "This is an automated daily commit". This is part of a student's assignment involving automation and data sourcing, and shows the configuration of a scheduled GitHub action., **[Discussion Image by 21f2000588]** This image shows a student's configuration of a GitHub Actions workflow for the TDS GA4 project, aimed at automating daily commits. The file `/TDS_GA_4/.github/workflows/daily-commit.yml` is open, displaying the YAML configuration which defines a "Daily Commit" workflow. This workflow is scheduled to run daily at 00:00 UTC and includes steps to checkout the repository, set up Git configuration (user email and name), create a file with a commit message, and commit the changes. The student seems to be sharing their setup for peer review or troubleshooting within the TDS GA4 discussion thread, likely seeking feedback or assistance in ensuring the automated commits function as intended. It represents a student's attempt to implement a specific task, potentially revealing confusion points or areas where guidance is needed. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 21f2000588]** This is an example of student code in a TDS GA4 discussion showing a Github workflow file named "daily-commit.yml" located in the ".github/workflows" directory. The workflow is configured to make daily commits to a repository, as indicated by the 'name: Daily Commit' at the top of the file and the scheduled cron job that runs at 00:00 UTC. It is set to run on ubuntu-latest. The steps include checking out the repository, setting up Git configuration with the user's email and name set to "GitHub Actions," creating a file named "daily-commit.txt" with a message, and then committing the changes. This appears to be student's implemented solution. 2x" data-dominant-color="10151B">image1916×882 65.1 KB
