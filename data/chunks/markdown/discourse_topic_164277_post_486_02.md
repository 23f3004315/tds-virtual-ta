Even tried getting python:3.12-slim separatly and trying again but that also didnâ€™t work.

I think there is some problem in getting python:3.12-slim as the build always stops at this.

on asking ChatGPT it shows that some DNS or network issue is there. I even tried all the remedy that was provided on creating custom network etc. but this was also of no use

Kindly help me finding solution to this and pls mention any other assistance I may require to get this running

Thank You.
