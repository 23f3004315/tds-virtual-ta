@carlton I was trying to view a session, but since youtube is very distracting I tried to embed it on a site, but it throws this error

**[Discussion Image by 23f2003845]** The image shows an embedded video player displaying a "Video unavailable" error. Specifically, it indicates "Playback on other websites has been disabled by the video owner," with a link to "Watch on YouTube." This suggests a discussion about the accessibility of embedded video resources and potentially a student being unable to access course material due to restrictions set by the content creator. The resolution is to directly access the video on the YouTube platform itself, as intended by the owner. The error is not related to any data science tool but related to a limitation set on a video on an external site. to access the video directly on YouTube." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="2VpWUPhJbsQZOip72voLFn4sXxt" width="690" height="378" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2003845]** This image captures a video playback error encountered by a student while accessing course materials, likely in the "About the Tools in Data Science" category on TDS. The error message "Video unavailable" indicates that playback on external websites has been disabled by the video owner, preventing the embedded video from playing within the TDS platform. The UI displays an exclamation mark icon and provides a "Watch on YouTube" link as an alternative. This suggests a possible restriction imposed by the content creator or YouTube, requiring users to directly view the video on the YouTube platform rather than within the TDS website. The student will need to follow the link to YouTube to access the content. This is a common issue that students may face, resolved by navigating to the original source., **[Discussion Image by 23f2003845]** This image, posted by student 23f2003845 in the "About the Tools in Data Science" category, shows a typical YouTube error message where a video is unavailable due to playback on other websites being disabled by the video owner. This is likely a student encountering a broken embedded link, and it represents a potential interruption to their learning. The message also provides a direct solution by suggesting the user "Watch on YouTube," implying that viewing the video on the YouTube platform itself might bypass the restriction. Therefore, the student can resolve this by navigating directly to YouTube. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2003845]** This image captures a potential learning obstacle within a data science course, specifically related to accessing video content. The screenshot shows a YouTube error message: "Video unavailable. Playback on other websites has been disabled by the video owner." This indicates that a student attempted to watch an embedded video but the video's owner has restricted playback to the YouTube platform itself. A potential solution for the student is to click the "Watch on YouTube" link to view the video directly on the YouTube website, which would bypass the embedding restriction. This scenario could initiate a peer discussion if multiple students face the same issue. 2x" data-dominant-color="3E3E3E">image2852Ã—1564 131 KB
