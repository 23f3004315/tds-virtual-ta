**[Discussion Image by 23f2003853]** This image depicts a student's attempt to retrieve data via a web API, likely as part of a deployment tools exercise in the TDS Jan 2025 cohort. The student is accessing the endpoint "127.0.0.1:8000/api" with query parameters that filter by different classes: "class=6X&class=5T&class=78&class=22". The browser displays a JSON response containing an array of student objects, each having "studentId" and "class" fields, for example, {"studentId":67,"class":"6X"}, illustrating that the API is successfully returning student data. The issue likely revolves around the student needing to understand how to properly filter and format the API requests based on class criteria.s an array of student objects, where each object contains a `studentId` and a `class` field, implying a query that is attempting to retrieve students belonging to multiple classes (6X, 5T, 78, and 22). The student likely posted this image in the discussion forum seeking help on how the query is behaving or to understand the structure of the JSON data returned. This shows the raw output from the API before any processing." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="7codiS7XrSgjFgmHrFUbJvgdxGv" width="602" height="320">image602Ã—320 48 KB
