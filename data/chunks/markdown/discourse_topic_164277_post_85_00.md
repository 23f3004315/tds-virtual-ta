## Post #85 by carlton

We will be doing project session on Tuesday 9 Feb [correction] Tuesday 11th of Feb (thanks @23f1002382 @23f2000237) . Project 1 uses the things you learnt in week 1-3. But mostly week 2 &amp; 3.

We dont do it in the beginning, (but introduced it 2 weeks ago in a live session), to give students chance to practise the new learnings from week 2 &amp; 3.

The plan has always been to demonstrate a few tasks and have you try doing the rest.

Kind regards
