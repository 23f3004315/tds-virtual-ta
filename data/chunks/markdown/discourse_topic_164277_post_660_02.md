This is likely shared as context to a question about project structure, version control, or initial setup problems, thus enabling peers or instructors to better understand the student's current state." data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/r1n9wAbkyVZ6YE3LxAtiumMQsLt.png?dl=1" title="image" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">**[Discussion Image by HARISH.S]** This image, posted by student HARISH.S in the "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent - Discussion Thread", shows the GitHub repository structure for a "hello_world" project. The repository includes a LICENSE file, a README.md file, and an "app.py" Python script, indicating the project is likely a basic Python application. The interface displays standard GitHub features like the Code, Issues, Pull Requests, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, and Settings tabs. Also visible are controls for adding files, viewing code, and searching within the repository. The user, Harish018S, has made 4 commits to the project, with the most recent one being "Create app.py". This could be a starting point for a student question around the implementation of "app.py".ation agent. Students can likely navigate to this GitHub repository to examine the initial code structure and file organization used in "hello_world" as a starting point for their own TDS automation agent projects." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="r1n9wAbkyVZ6YE3LxAtiumMQsLt" width="690" height="372" srcset="**[Discussion Image by HARISH.S]** This image depicts the GitHub repository "hello_world" owned by user "Harish018S," likely a student sharing their project for the TDS "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent" discussion.

The repository's main branch contains files such as `LICENSE`, `README.md`, and `app.py`, all created approximately two months prior. The UI elements visible include the GitHub repository interface with options to "Add file", view "<> Code", manage branches ("main" selected), and search within the repository. The image indicates the repository is public, and has 2 branches and 4 commits. This is likely a student showcasing the initial setup of their project repository for peer review or instructor feedback, a common step in collaborative coding projects. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by HARISH.S]** This image depicts a student, HARISH.S, sharing his "hello_world" project repository on GitHub within the TDS discussion thread.

The GitHub interface shows standard navigation elements like "Code", "Issues", "Pull requests", and buttons to "Add file" and view the code, suggesting Harish is likely sharing his project's structure or code for peer review or to illustrate a point in the discussion. The image serves as visual context for other students to understand the project's setup and potentially troubleshoot similar implementation issues in their own automation agents. Because the student's code is visible, others can provide specific feedback about their approach. 2x" data-dominant-color="12171C">image1330×718 54.7 KB
