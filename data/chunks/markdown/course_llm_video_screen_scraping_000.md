## LLM Video Screen-Scraping

Video screen-scraping with LLMs is a powerful technique for extracting structured data from screen recordings. This approach works with any visible screen content and bypasses traditional web scraping limitations like authentication or anti-scraping measures.

[**[Course Image: Screen Scraping with Gemini]** This image demonstrates using Google AI Studio with the Gemini Pro 1.5 model for screen scraping, specifically extracting data from a tweet displayed in the input. The user provides system instructions to "Extract all the information in these tweets as JSON". The model then attempts to fulfill this instruction, outputting a JSON representation of the tweet data. This illustrates how LLMs can be used to parse visual content from screens, enabling data extraction even without traditional APIs. Understanding this process is crucial for bypassing web scraping limitations, as the LLM can interpret the visual elements directly.le AI Studio to extract information from tweets displayed in an image, showcasing a screen scraping technique. The user uploads an image of tweets into Google AI Studio and then prompts the model, specifically Gemini 1.5 Pro, to "Extract all the information in these tweets as JSON." This utilizes the model's ability to understand visual content and process the text within the image. The expected outcome is to receive structured data in JSON format, allowing for further analysis or integration with other applications. This method can be useful for extracting data from visual sources that are not directly accessible through APIs or traditional scraping methods.)](https://youtu.be/2G1LqS6qO5s)

Key benefits:

- No setup cost or authentication handling
- Works with any visible screen content
- Full control over data exposure
- Extremely cost-effective (< $0.001 per short video)
- Bypasses anti-scraping measures
- Handles varying formats and layouts

### Quick Start Example

Here's a basic workflow using Google's AI Studio and Gemini:

1. **Record the Screen**
 - Use QuickTime (Mac) or Windows Game Bar (Windows), Screen2Gif, or any tool of your choice
 - Select specific screen area containing target data
 - Record scrolling/clicking through content
 - Keep recordings short (30-60 seconds)
2. **Process with Gemini**
 - Upload to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/prompts)
 - Select Gemini 1.5 Flash (cost-effective)
 - Prompt for structured output (JSON/CSV)
