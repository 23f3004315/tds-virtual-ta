## Post #160 by ripusudan

**Direct Link**: [Post #160](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/169029/160)

I am trying to create a student account on Microsoft Azure using my IIT Madras email ID (**23f2004705@ds.study.iitm.ac.in**), but I am encountering an issue. The system is showing a message that my email domain is not currently registered with them, and it is asking me to use another verification method.

@carlton @Jivraj Could you please guide me on how to proceed with the verification or if there is an alternative method to access Azureâ€™s student benefits?
