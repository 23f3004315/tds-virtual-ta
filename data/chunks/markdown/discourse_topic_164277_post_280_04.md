**[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image shows OpenAI's API pricing page, likely shared by a student in the discussion to compare costs for different GPT-4o models for the LLM-based automation agent project. The page displays the cost breakdowns for GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, specifying the input, cached input, and output prices per 1 million tokens. Specifically, the GPT-4o input cost is $2.50/1M tokens, cached input is $1.25/1M tokens, and the output cost is $10.00/1M tokens. For GPT-4o mini, the input cost is $0.150/1M tokens, cached input is $0.075/1M tokens, and output is $0.600/1M tokens. This information assists students in making cost-effective decisions when selecting a model for their project.eeds, possibly balancing performance and budget constraints." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-14 183844" data-base62-sha1="hpybf5VWgkRP2wPZWvJVRMWMGIg" width="690" height="357" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image likely represents a student's shared screenshot to help clarify a point about pricing. It shows the OpenAI API pricing page at openai.com/api/pricing/. The webpage displays the cost per million tokens for the GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini models. The prices are broken down into input, cached input, and output costs, with GPT-4o being significantly more expensive than the mini version. The student likely posted this as part of a discussion about which model to use given cost constraints., **[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image depicts a screenshot of the OpenAI API pricing page, specifically showing the costs associated with using GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini models. It shows a comparison between the two models highlighting the pricing for input, cached input, and output tokens, with GPT-4o being more expensive than GPT-4o mini. The prices are listed per 1 million tokens, showing GPT-4o with an input cost of $2.50, cached input cost of $1.25, and output cost of $10.00, while GPT-4o mini has an input cost of $0.150, cached input cost of $0.075, and output cost of $0.600. This is likely part of a student discussion about the cost implications of choosing different LLM models for their project. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image from a student discussion thread titled "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent" shows a screenshot of the OpenAI API pricing page, likely posted by a student to reference or discuss the cost differences between the GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini models. The screenshot highlights the pricing for both models, showing "input", "cached input", and "output" costs per 1 million tokens. For GPT-4o, the costs are $2.50, $1.25, and $10.00 respectively, while GPT-4o mini costs $0.150, $0.075, and $0.600 per million tokens.
