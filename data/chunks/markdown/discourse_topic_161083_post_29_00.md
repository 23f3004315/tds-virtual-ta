Thanks @carlton.

I answered questions on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ but didn’t click on the button “Submit Answers” on seek as my answers for 2 questions were incorrect.

My question is whether I need to submit on seek to save answers on Exam? (I checked my score and saved it on the exam site.)
