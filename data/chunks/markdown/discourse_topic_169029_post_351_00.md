## Post #351 by 23f2004912

@carlton I’m noticing frequent requests from globally scattered IPs—mostly from cloud or bulletproof hosts like DigitalOcean, Contabo, and Azure—targeting sensitive paths like `/t4`, `/logincheck`, `/.env`, and `/.git/config`. These include IPs from places like New York (162.243.238.100), London (34.89.64.89), Amsterdam (45.148.10.172), Moscow (84.201.151.18), Jaipur (103.175.163.104), and Vilnius (85.255.108.243). It really seems like automated vulnerability scanning or botnet activity. Carlton, what can I do??
