**[Discussion Image by 21f3002277]** This image is from a student discussion on the TDS Solver project, showing the configuration of inbound port rules for a virtual machine. It seems a student is encountering a warning message and is probably asking about it. The UI elements show options to select which network ports are accessible from the public internet. The "Public inbound ports" section has two options: "None" and "Allow selected ports." The "Allow selected ports" option is selected, with SSH (22) chosen as the inbound port. An alert box warns "This will allow all IP addresses to access your virtual machine. This is only recommended for testing. Use the Advanced controls in the Networking tab to create rules to limit inbound traffic to known IP addresses." The student is likely seeking clarification on the implications of opening port 22 and how to limit access using the advanced networking controls.") or to allow only selected ports. "Allow selected ports" is checked, and the "Select inbound ports" dropdown has "SSH (22)" selected as the open port, allowing SSH access. A warning message is displayed below the dropdown, cautioning that this configuration will allow all IP addresses to access the virtual machine and is only recommended for testing, advising the user to use advanced controls in the Networking tab to limit inbound traffic by IP address. This setup likely arises from a student following instructions to configure their VM for the TDS project, but getting a warning about security implications." alt="Screenshot 2025-03-31 074845" data-base62-sha1="g0l5GhYBx6QlzPxrcbPTkWuK0WN" width="690" height="191" data-dominant-color="FAF8F8">Screenshot 2025-03-31 0748451267Ã—351 16.2 KB
