## Post #1 by ankit.jain

**Direct Link**: [Post #1](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/99838/1)

This thread is **not** about:

*- request to change grading pattern*

*- request to change ROE formula*

*- request to grant free marks*

*- to crib/cry for anything related to marks*

Here I wish to ask about:

**Q.1:** what is that learning, which this course want us to prove through ROE exam?

**Q.2:** Is it possible to answer 17 questions fairly without fluking within 30 minutes using formal methods? (just by solving them properly)

**Q.3:** What is the knowledge, using which I can solve all 17 questions within 30 minutes (without fluking &amp; without socializing/chatting/asking (with) others)?

I feel, my Q3 is little bit combination of Q2 &amp; Q1, still I am looking forward for all 3 answers separately. Please help me to understand the real essence of this ROE quiz.

Thanks in anticipation,
