**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image displays a sample of the dataset being used in "Project 2 - TDS Solver," showing transaction data. The data includes columns such as TransactionID, Customer Name, Country, Date, Product/Code, Sales (in USD), and Cost (in USD). There are records for various customers and countries, and the date formats are inconsistent. The sales data are given in USD, the product codes consist of some string of letter and numbers, and all transactions have a corresponding cost. This data is likely used for students to practice data manipulation and analysis within the TDS Solver project.The "Country" column contains variations like "IND", "US", "United Kingdom", "Ind", "Fra", "AE", "U.S.A", "U.K", and "Bra" which could pose data cleaning challenges. The "Date" column has both 'YYYY/MM/DD' and 'MM-DD-YYYY' formats requiring consistent formatting for analysis. Values are populated across multiple rows offering insight into data structure. It is important to clean the inconsistency of data such as country and date before using it to get accurate results." alt="friend data" data-base62-sha1="44GCKKbbLnhDqsoaago0XJzY3h4" width="690" height="342" data-dominant-color="EBEBEB">friend data938×465 20.5 KB
