**[Discussion Image by 23ds1000022]** This image captures a student submission on the TDS (The Developer School) platform within the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" assignment, due Jan 26, 2025. The student, working on an exercise that requires running the Llamafile model and creating an ngrok tunnel, has entered their ngrok URL (https://b1ae-117-198-90-156.ngrok-free.app) into the provided text box. However, an error message appears, indicating "Response is not valid JSON" and specifically an "Error code: 501" with the message "Unsupported method ('POST')." This indicates the student's ngrok tunnel might be configured to expect a different HTTP method (likely GET), or the endpoint itself doesn't support POST requests which is likely the cause of the assessment platform returning the error. This requires the student to re-examine the llamafile server setup or the tunneling configuration to ensure it supports the expected request type or uses a different method. assessment system likely uses to validate the service. It's a potential sign that the Llamafile server isn't properly configured to handle the POST request." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-23 at 4.12.45 PM" data-base62-sha1="eIRhNXXkAcZBNHHbZK4I4vkaVda" width="690" height="431" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23ds1000022]** This image captures a student's question during a TDS "Deployment Tools" discussion, specifically concerning the GA2 assignment in January 2025. The student is attempting to submit an ngrok URL, presumably for a Llamafile server as instructed: "Create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok. What is the ngrok URL?". However, upon submitting "https://b1ae-117-198-90-156.ngrok-free.app", the platform returns an error: "Error: Response is not valid JSON: ... Error code: 501 Message: Unsupported method ('POST')...", suggesting a potential issue with how the server is handling POST requests or a mismatch in expected data format when the platform tries to validate the URL. The student needs to troubleshoot the ngrok setup, the Llamafile server, or the assignment submission process to resolve this 501 error., **[Discussion Image by 23ds1000022]** This image shows a student's attempt to submit an ngrok URL to a TDS (Training Data Science) exam, specifically "GA2 - Deployment Tools" due on January 26, 2025. The student is prompted to download and run a Llamafile model and create an ngrok tunnel. After entering the ngrok URL (https://b1ae-117-198-90-156.ngrok-free.app), the system returns an error: "Response is not valid JSON" along with the HTML error message indicating a "501 - Server does not support this operation" and the unsupported method is POST. This likely means the student's ngrok tunnel is not properly configured to handle the POST request expected by the exam system, indicating a potential issue with the Llamafile server setup or the way ngrok is forwarding the request. The student is currently stuck with a score of 5.5/10 and seems to be facing an issue with connecting their ngrok tunnel to the grading system. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23ds1000022]** This image depicts a student's attempt to submit an ngrok URL to a General Assembly deployment tools assignment, specifically "GA2 - Deployment Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]". The student has downloaded Llamafile and is attempting to create a tunnel using ngrok. Upon submitting the generated ngrok URL, an error message appears indicating that the "Response is not valid JSON" and includes HTML content showing a 501 error code, which means "Unsupported method ('POST')". This indicates the server is rejecting the POST request likely due to misconfiguration, unsupported API endpoint or incorrect request type sent to the ngrok tunnel. 2x" data-dominant-color="ADB6B6">Screenshot 2025-01-23 at 4.12.45 PM1920Ã—1200 170 KB
