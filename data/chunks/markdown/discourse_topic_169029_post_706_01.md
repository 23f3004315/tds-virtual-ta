 this on my mail. Happy that everything worked out pretty well w/o the need for hardcoding. I’m guessing GA1-q18 bugged out because of escape sequences in the codeblock That’s LLMs for you!

Can’t expect 100% reliability, even at 0 temperature.

**[Discussion Image by thinkmachine]** This image displays a snippet of a JSON file named "22f3001642.json" from the TDS Solver project discussion, showing the results of automated tests. Specifically, it presents an array of test outcomes, including "test_code" and "status" for each test. The test "GA1_q18" resulted in an "ERROR" status, with the associated "error" message indicating a syntax error "near ```sql\nSELECT SUM(units * price) AS total_sales\nFROM tickets\nWHERE LOWER(type) = 'gold'; \n```". The other tests, "GA2_q3", "GA3_q2", "GA4_q6", and "GA5_q7" all "PASSED", implying that the student is facing a SQL syntax issue in their solution for the "GA1_q18" test case. The JSON format suggests the student is likely reviewing automated test output to identify and debug failures in their TDS solver project.ssue with their SQL query in "GA1_q18", highlighting an opportunity to debug the SQL syntax." alt="1000040555" data-base62-sha1="356F1L3GyY4an2rcZSQ6WFuPKov" width="291" height="375" srcset="**[Discussion Image by thinkmachine]** The image shows a JSON file, likely output from a TDS solver project, reflecting the results of multiple test cases. Specifically, file "22f3001642.json" indicates an error for test case "GA1_q18", showing a status of "ERROR" and a syntax error in the SQL query. The error message "near '```sql\nSELECT SUM(units * price) AS total_sales\nFROM tickets\nWHERE LOWER(type) = 'gold'; \n```': syntax error" suggests an issue with the SQL syntax of the query used in the GA1_q18 test case. Test cases "GA2_q3", "GA3_q2", "GA4_q6", and "GA5_q7" all returned "PASSED" status, indicating successful execution. This likely reflects a student's debugging process, identifying a specific SQL query failing a test., **[Discussion Image by thinkmachine]** This image shows a student's JSON output from a TDS solver project, indicating a potential error in an SQL query. The JSON file, "22f3001642.json," contains results for different test cases, with "GA1_q18" reporting an "ERROR". The error message indicates a "syntax error" near the SQL query: "SELECT SUM(units * price) AS total_sales FROM tickets WHERE LOWER(type) = 'gold';". The student likely needs to correct the SQL syntax in their solver for the "GA1_q18" test case, while the other test cases ("GA2_q3", "GA3_q2", "GA4_q6", "GA5_q7") passed successfully. The escaped newlines (`\n`) also suggests there may be some problems with how newlines are handled. This is likely a student question posted to the discussion thread asking for help on this error. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by thinkmachine]** This image depicts a JSON file, likely a test result from the TDS Solver project, indicating both passing and failing test cases. The file, named "22f3001642.json", contains an array of objects, each representing a test case with fields "test_code" and "status". Specifically, the test "GA1_q18" resulted in an "ERROR", with a detailed error message pointing to a syntax error near "sql" in the SELECT statement: "near \" sql\nSELECT SUM(units * price) AS total_sales\nFROM tickets\nWHERE LOWER(type) = 'gold';\n```\": syntax error". The remaining tests, "GA2_q3", "GA3_q2", "GA4_q6", and "GA5_q7", all have a "status" of "PASSED", suggesting the student is debugging the SQL query associated with "GA1_q18". 2x" data-dominant-color="0C0C0D">10000405551080×1387 193 KB
