It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question.

You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading.

Kind regards
