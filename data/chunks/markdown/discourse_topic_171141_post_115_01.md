**[Discussion Image by Vihaanv07]** This image depicts a technical error encountered by a student during a TDS project, specifically related to running a task involving a Python script and the `uv` package. The error messages indicate two problems: first, an "HTTP/1.1 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR" when making a POST request to `localhost:8503/run`, and second, a "429 Client Error: Too Many Requests" when attempting to access the OpenAI chat completions API. This suggests the student's code or the server it interacts with is either experiencing internal issues or exceeding the allowed request rate for the OpenAI API. This is likely a peer discussion or instructor response due to the technical nature of the error and troubleshooting involved.Gist, passing the student's email as an argument. However, the process results in an "HTTP/1.1 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR", followed by an "HTTP 500" error indicating "429 Client Error: Too Many Requests" to the OpenAI completions endpoint. This likely indicates a rate limiting issue on the OpenAI API being used by the script, suggesting the student is exceeding the allowed number of requests." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="wGBtBjy5Hn6BmqWVgWkMoWH9dX" width="690" height="126" data-dominant-color="F4F4F4">image1505Ã—276 16.1 KB
