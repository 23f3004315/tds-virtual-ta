 like missing paramaters like… So basically sometimes it needs resetting the request parser and then it works perfectly fine.

`{
 "detail": "execute() missing 1 required positional argument: 'file_bytes'"
}
`
Which is incorrect, so if we press the RESET button and execute it works properly.

**[Discussion Image by 21f2000588]** This image shows the "Parameters" section of a TDS solver tool web UI, likely during a student's experimentation. Under "Request body", both "question" and "file" are marked as required fields, indicating user input is needed for successful execution. The "question" field contains the string "Download and use multi-cursors and convert it into a single". The "file" field has a file chosen: "q-multi-cursor.json.txt", and the type allowed is `string | (string | null)($binary)`. The data is being sent as `multipart/form-data`. The "Execute" button is available to submit the request, along with "Clear", "Cancel", and "Reset" buttons.aring to execute the request after setting the question and file parameters, suggesting they are seeking to resolve a problem related to multi-cursor data processing." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="kPDeypLAWIcNSPPLrpEnQMvHzHx" width="690" height="280" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 21f2000588]** This image depicts a student's interaction with the TDS solver's API interface, showing parameter settings for the project. The "Request body" is configured as "multipart/form-data," with two required fields: "question" and "file." The "question" field contains the instruction: "Download and use multi-cursors and convert it into a single," and the "file" field is set to "q-multi-cursor.json.txt." A checkbox to "Send empty value" is also visible for the file parameter. The "Execute" and "Clear" buttons are available for interaction with the API, and the "Cancel" and "Reset" buttons appear at the top. This demonstrates a student configuring the API request to process a multi-cursor JSON file according to the given instructions., **[Discussion Image by 21f2000588]** This image depicts a student question within the "Project 2 - TDS Solver" discussion, showing the UI for making an API request and specifying parameters. Under "Request body," the "question" field requires a string, and the student has entered "Download and use multi-cursors and convert it into a single." The "file" field expects either a string or binary data, and the student has chosen the file "q-multi-cursor-json.txt." The UI also shows options to "Cancel" or "Reset" the form, the "multipart/form-data" selection, a "Send empty value" checkbox for the file, and "Execute" and "Clear" buttons, indicating an attempt to process multiple cursors into a single one by uploading a file and including a question string for context. No specific error messages are visible in the interface, but the highlighted required fields suggest an initial submission is pending, and the student is likely troubleshooting the correct way to structure their API call. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 21f2000588]** This image depicts a student configuring the TDS solver interface to execute a project task, specifically converting multiple cursors into a single one, showcasing a troubleshooting and debugging context. The "Parameters" section indicates no parameters are explicitly set, while the "Request body" section contains the required inputs. The student has specified "Download and use multi-cursors and convert it into a single" as the question. They've also selected "q-multi-cursor-json.txt" as the file to be processed by clicking the "Choose File" button. The request body is set to "multipart/form-data". Buttons for "Execute," "Clear," "Cancel," and "Reset" are visible, offering UI controls. This setup suggests a step-by-step approach to testing and validating the TDS solver functionality related to the multi-cursor conversion task. 2x" data-dominant-color="E8F4F2">image1775×721 21.8 KB
