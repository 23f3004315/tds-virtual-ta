Evaluations will start before this weekend, with some sampling done possibly even tonight and most evaluation runs tomorrow.

Also we will prime the target first by sending a dummy request so it gets “warmed up” because some of you have reported time to respond to first request takes time for the server to spin up.

Then once we know its responding, we will send requests for evaluation.

Kind regards
