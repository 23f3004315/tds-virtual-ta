Yes Sir, I also completed 6 GAs even tho it was written only best 4 out of 7 GAs would be considered for final grade, but couldnâ€™t complete GA 7 due to pressure of other subjects, if it was written in the grading document I would have done it, hoping you would understand Sir, Please do consider our request.

Thank you
