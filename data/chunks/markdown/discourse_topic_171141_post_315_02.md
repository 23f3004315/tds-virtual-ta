**[Discussion Image by 22f2000008]** The image shows a student's IDE, indicating a peer discussion or question based on the "TDS-official-Project1-discrepancies" discussion title. The student is working on a FastAPI project, visible through files like `app.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksApy.py`, `tasksBpy.py` and the imports inside `app.py`, including `FastAPI`, `HTTPException`, and `PlainTextResponse`. The terminal output reveals that Task A10 failed, showing an expected result of 177250.79 but an actual result of 200401.84 when querying `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt` via a GET request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`, suggesting an issue with the logic calculating total sales for the "Gold" ticket type from the SQLite database file. The project's score is currently 4/10, and the student is working in the directory `C:\Users\avina\Desktop\TDS_Project3`.tions on ticket sales data." alt="WhatsApp Image 2025-04-06 at 17.28.47_927a687b" data-base62-sha1="97nvuIRMFIEIuCEkd2FfDvH3O97" width="666" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f2000008]** The image depicts a student's attempt at Task A10 in a TDS project, showing the results of an HTTP request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`. The task involves calculating the total sales for "Gold" tickets from a SQLite database. The expected result is 177250.79, but the actual result calculated by the student's code is 200401.84, causing the task to fail ("A10 FAILED"). The screenshot displays the relevant `app.py` file in the editor, along with the output in the terminal, illustrating a discrepancy between the expected and calculated values, indicating a potential error in the student's code logic or data handling. The score is currently 4/10., **[Discussion Image by 22f2000008]** The image shows a student, Avinash Kumar, facing a failed test case ("A10 FAILED") in a programming project related to TDS. The terminal output indicates that Task A10 involves querying a SQLite database file ('/data/ticket-sales.db') for total sales of "Gold" tickets and writing the result to '/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt'. The expected total sales value is 177250.79, but the student's code returned 200401.84, suggesting a discrepancy in their calculation or data retrieval logic. The screenshot also displays the project's file structure in VS Code, including `app.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, and data-related files. The student's score is currently 4/10, implying issues with other test cases as well. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f2000008]** This image captures a student's coding project in VS Code, showing a discrepancy between the expected and actual result for task A10, reflected as a failed test case, indicating peer discussion or potentially seeking help from an instructor. The student is working on a FastAPI application, using SQLite to manage ticket sales data, specifically extracting the total sales of "Gold" tickets. The output panel shows an "A10 Failed" message because the 'RESULT' (200401.84) does not match the 'EXPECTED' value (177250.79), implying an error in the student's code or query related to `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt` retrieval and calculation, with the project path `C:\Users\avina\Desktop\TDS_Project3`. The student's score is 4/10, suggesting multiple failed test cases related to task A and task B, which are imported. 2x" data-dominant-color="5A5D5E">WhatsApp Image 2025-04-06 at 17.28.47_927a687b1600×1200 181 KB
