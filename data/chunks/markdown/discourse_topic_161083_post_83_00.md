## Post #83 by gokulvasudevan.s

**Direct Link**: [Post #83](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/161083/83)

GA1 Q18. What is the total sales of all the items in the “Gold” ticket type? Write SQL to calculate it.

I always get the answer in a nested array. Error: Got [[51006.69]]…

I could not use cursor in that shell, to extract the value also.

@carlton @Jivraj Please help me with this.
