, based on the broader theme of archiving, the presenters likely explore methods for organizing, storing, and retrieving information effectively. The educational objective is to familiarize students with archiving strategies and relevant tools, essential for managing digital information in the ITM BS program.)](https://youtu.be/Dj7X0bQRJSs)

### Tools in Data Science Orientation

[**[Course Image: TDS Orientation, May 2022]** This image is a black screen with the word "Dixon" displayed in the center and the Zoom logo in the bottom right corner. Since the surrounding content discusses "Tools in Data Science Orientation" and archiving, this may represent a speaker, "Dixon", presenting during a Zoom session, and the recording of this session would be an example of archival. Archiving in this context relates to storing recordings and materials from meetings or sessions, like this Zoom orientation. In this way, information can be preserved and accessed later for reference and training purposes. Understanding the context of who is speaking and the medium they are using helps students understand the archival process of data science educational content.rom a Zoom meeting with the name "Dixon" displayed. As part of the TDS orientation and "archive" curriculum, understanding different data sources and communication platforms like Zoom is important. While the image itself doesn't directly demonstrate an "archiving" technique, it implies archiving might involve capturing meeting data, recording discussions, or saving shared files from such platforms. Students should consider how data generated from tools like Zoom can be effectively archived and managed in data science projects. This relates to the broader understanding of data governance and lifecycle management covered in the course.)](https://youtu.be/_c_aFQ0ObLo?t=4186)
