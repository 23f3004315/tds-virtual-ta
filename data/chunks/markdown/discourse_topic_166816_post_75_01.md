**[Discussion Image by shubham6]** This image shows a student's view of a graded assignment dashboard, likely related to the TDS 2025 course on the `exam.sanand.workers.dev` domain, showing potential scoring issues. The student is logged in as `22f1001901@ds.study.iitm.ac.in.` The top of the interface indicates that the assignment ended on February 2, 2025, at 11:59 PM IST, displaying a `Score: 0` in a red notification bar, alongside "Check all" and "Save" buttons. Below this, under "Recent saves", the dashboard displays multiple save entries from February 2nd and 3rd, all showing a `Score: 8`. Finally, the initial questions in the assignment are listed, such as "Write documentation in Markdown (1 mark)" and "Compress an image (1 mark)", creating the impression that the student has completed the assignment but the final score is incorrect. This suggests a student is experiencing a problem with their graded assignment score not reflecting their submitted work.uestions for the assignment, such as "Write documentation in Markdown (1 mark)" and "Compress an image (1 mark)", are displayed, suggesting the student completed the assignment but the displayed score is not reflecting their work, creating confusion. The student is logged in with their IITM email, and action buttons include "Check all," "Save," "Logout," and "Reload," indicating attempts to refresh or resubmit the assignment to resolve the score discrepancy. This suggests the student is encountering a technical issue with the dashboard, leading to their post in the discussion forum." alt="w2tdse" data-base62-sha1="fmCc8EiS7ED2kXPvguIONCItGZO" width="620" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by shubham6]** This image depicts a student's view of a "Graded Assignment" dashboard, specifically for the "TDS 2025 Jan GA2" assignment. The UI displays a red banner indicating the assignment ended on Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST, and the displayed "Score" is 0. The user is logged in as "22f1001901@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". A "Recent saves" section shows a list of saved submissions with scores of 8 from dates including "2/3/2025, 12:00:30 AM" and "2/2/2025, 11:53:32 PM", conflicting with the 0 score shown in the banner, likely the source of the user's confusion documented in the surrounding discussion. The questions for the assignment are listed below the saves, beginning with "Write documentation in Markdown (1 mark)"., **[Discussion Image by shubham6]** This image depicts a student's view of a graded assignment dashboard in the IITM-PDS Data Science program, likely related to the "TDS 2025 Jan GA2" course. The student, logged in as "22f1001901@ds.study.iitm.ac.in," observes a discrepancy between the displayed final score (0) and the recent save logs, which show a score of 8 on multiple attempts, including the most recent save from 2/3/2025. The UI shows "Ended at Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" which may indicate that there is a time-based issue that is not reflecting the student's latest score. The page has options to "Check all" and "Save", and each recent save has a "Reload" option, potentially allowing the student to revert to a specific previous submission; the first two questions listed are "Write documentation in Markdown" and "Compress an image". This suggests the student is facing an issue where the displayed score doesn't accurately reflect their saved progress, leading to potential confusion about their grading. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by shubham6]** This image depicts a student's view of a graded assignment dashboard in the TDS (presumably, a course related to data science at IIT Madras). The dashboard shows that the assignment "Ended at Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST," but the current displayed "Score: 0". Under the "Recent Saves" section, the dashboard displays a history of saved attempts, including timestamps and scores; the student has multiple saves on Feb 2, 2025, around the deadline, and one on Feb 3, 2025, showing "Score: 8" for each. The presence of the "Reload" button next to each save suggests the student can revert to those earlier saved states. The student is logged in with their IITM email and the question list indicates two questions visible: "Write documentation in Markdown (1 mark)" and "Compress an image (1 mark)." The discrepancy between the displayed score of '0' and the saved scores of '8' seems to be the source of the student's confusion, prompting their question in the discussion. 2x" data-dominant-color="2D2A2C">w2tdse1100Ã—886 50.3 KB
