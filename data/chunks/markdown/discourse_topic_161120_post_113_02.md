**[Discussion Image by 23F3002987_J_SRI_BAL]** This image shows a student question within a TDS discussion thread regarding Vercel deployment. The student is attempting to deploy a Python app to Vercel, creating an API endpoint that should return JSON data ("marks": [10, 20]) based on name parameters. The student asks for clarification on what the Vercel URL should look like, expecting something like `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`. However, when they attempt to use their actual Vercel URL (`https://vercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-projects-ec088a33.vercel.app/api`), they receive a `TypeError: Failed to fetch` error, indicating a potential problem fetching data from the deployed API. The student is likely facing a problem either with the deployment itself, an issue with the API endpoint, or a CORS-related problem, despite being instructed to enable CORS.ents to download a `q-vercel-python.json` file, create and deploy a Python application to Vercel, and expose an API endpoint. The desired API should return a JSON response containing the marks of specified names when queried with parameters like `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y`, with an expected output format resembling `{"marks": [10, 20]}`. The student is also reminded to enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin. The student has provided their Vercel URL, `https://vercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-projects-ec088a33.vercel.app/api`, but is encountering a `TypeError: Failed to fetch` error. This suggests a potential problem with either the deployed API's code, the URL, or network connectivity." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="8hfkvlJTOviOyW6kFMD5TSqG6EB" width="690" height="181" data-dominant-color="D5D4D5">image1312×345 16.5 KB
