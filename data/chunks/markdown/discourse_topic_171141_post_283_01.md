**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image shows a snippet of a `Dockerfile` for a TDS project, hosted on GitHub under the repository `tds-project1` by user `GaURaVinDeX`. The Dockerfile begins by specifying the base image as `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` and proceeds to install dependencies using `apt-get`. It then downloads and installs `uv`, followed by installing FastAPI and Uvicorn using `pip`. Crucially, the Dockerfile sets the working directory to `/app` using `WORKDIR /app` and copies the application file `app.py` into the container's `/app` directory using `COPY app.py /app`. The final command explicitly sets the binary path and executes the `app.py` file using the command `CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]`. The red box and arrow highlight the lines related to copying the application files. This likely accompanies a student's question about this part of the Dockerfile.on likely revolves around properly configuring the Dockerfile for the TDS project." alt="Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 11.13.32 am" data-base62-sha1="zTvhuV9P7svIcyq9FN5wLIOBno" width="690" height="493" srcset="**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image shows a snippet of a `Dockerfile` from a student's (GaURaVinDeX) GitHub repository for the `tds-project1` project. The Dockerfile includes instructions for setting up a Python 3.12 environment, installing dependencies like `fastapi` and `uvicorn`, and copying the application files (`app.py`) into the `/app` directory within the Docker container. The relevant section highlighted with a red box contains the `WORKDIR /app` instruction, which sets the working directory, followed by `COPY app.py /app` instruction to copy application files into the container. This snippet is likely being discussed by students to understand the Dockerfile setup or resolve issues related to file paths and execution within the container. The discussion likely revolves around ensuring the application code is correctly placed and executed within the Docker environment., **[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image depicts a student's Dockerfile from the TDS project 1, displayed within a GitHub repository interface. The file begins by specifying a Python 3.12 base image and installs dependencies like curl and ca-certificates using apt-get. It proceeds to download and install uv, a Python package installer, using `ADD` and `RUN` commands. Next, FastAPI and Uvicorn are installed with pip. To make the installed binary accessible, the PATH environment variable is modified. Finally, the working directory is set to `/app`, the application files (`app.py`) are copied into this directory, and the command to run the application is specified using the uv package manager. The red box and arrow highlights the lines `WORKDIR /app` and `COPY app.py /app`, indicating a likely point of student focus or a specific question related to these instructions within the Dockerfile. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image depicts a portion of a Dockerfile within the TDS project discussion, specifically showing the steps involved in setting up the application directory and copying application files. The Dockerfile, named "Dockerfile", is located in the "tds-project1" directory and the initial commit was done by "GaURaVinDeX". The relevant lines (16-20) include setting the working directory to `/app` using `WORKDIR /app` and copying the application files (app.py) into the `/app` directory using `COPY app.py /app`. This snippet is likely used to troubleshoot or clarify the correct way to configure the Dockerfile for the project. The arrow highlights the specific lines within the Dockerfile being discussed. 2x" data-dominant-color="F8F8F8">Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 11.13.32 am2116Ã—1512 323 KB
