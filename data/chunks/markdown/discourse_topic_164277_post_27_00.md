Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environmen

In Tuesday’s(21 January) session we had discussed docker towards ending of session.

What was discussed in that live session regarding docker:

Search for existing containers on repositories such as dockerhub.
Pull an existing docker image.
Run that image inside a container.
Enter to that container and modify something(such as installing python inside a ubuntu container, for customization or create some file)
Once done you can commit it.
And push customized container’s image to docker hub.

Regarding local models running for project1, it’s a good idea, we will see if it’s possible to discuss in session.
