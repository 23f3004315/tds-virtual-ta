Q5 I tried with openfire and python script , both are giving me same answer but its not accepted please check . Also in task the ask is to identify " **Top-Performing City:** Determine which city has the highest total unit sales for the selected product and report the unit sales number." but on top of input box question is different “How many units of Table were sold in Mexico City on transactions with at least 159 units?”
