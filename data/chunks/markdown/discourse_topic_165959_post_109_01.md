**[Discussion Image by 23f2003853]** This image represents a student's question within the TDS student discussion, specifically focusing on GA4 data sourcing and related issues. The student inquires about the markdown content of a PDF, formatted using prettier@3.4.2, presenting what appears to be an attempt at a markdown list with items like "cuppedia tamquam facilis confugo", "conservo depereo", "consectetur arx", and "aeternus celebrer". However, the output displays an error message: "Error: Missing lists," and the list items are underlined with a red wavy line, indicating a syntax or formatting issue with the markdown list. It shows that the list has not been parsed correctly.ntent of the PDF, formatted with prettier@3.4.2?". The content shown is a series of lines starting with hyphens, resembling a list in Markdown: "- cuppedia tamquam facilis confugo", "- conservo depereo", "- consectetur arx", and "- aeternus celebrer". However, the system displays an "Error: Missing lists" message, indicating a problem recognizing or rendering the content as a valid Markdown list. This suggests an issue with the formatting or the configuration of Prettier in correctly interpreting the input." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="phlJLey3ptCvRxUHYz3lDy9aFPx" width="690" height="168" data-dominant-color="FCFAFA">image1108Ã—271 5.87 KB
