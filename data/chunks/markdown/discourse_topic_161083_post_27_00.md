## Post #27 by Nelson

**Direct Link**: [Post #27](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/161083/27)

2 days ago I attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I didnâ€™t submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions.

When I logged in today it says score is 0.

Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again?

Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links?

If [seek] (Nptel Seekh) can access [TDS exam] (Technical Assessment) then why we need to submit from seek?
