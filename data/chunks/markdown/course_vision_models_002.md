 correlation implies causation; this image helps clarify the distinction by visually representing different degrees of association without implying a cause-and-effect relationship. By understanding how correlation is measured and interpreted, students can better analyze the performance and behavior of their vision models, particularly when dealing with feature selection or understanding model biases."}

Let's break down the request:

---

- `curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`: The API endpoint for text generation.
- `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`: The content type of the request.
- `-H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"`: The API key for authentication.
- `-d`: The request body.
 - `"model": "gpt-4o-mini"`: The model to use for text generation.
 - `"messages":`: The messages to send to the model.
 - `"role": "user"`: The role of the message.
 - `"content":`: The content of the message.
 - `{"type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?"}`: The text message.
 - `{"type": "image_url"}`: The image message.
 - `"detail": "low"`: The detail level of the image. `low` uses fewer tokens at lower detail. `high` uses more tokens for higher detail.
 - `"image_url": {"url": "**[Course Image: ]** This image illustrates the concept of correlation coefficient (ρ) in the context of vision models, demonstrating how it measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. A ρ of +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, where data points form an upward-sloping line, while a ρ of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, forming a downward-sloping line. Values between -1 and 0, and 0 and +1 represent weaker negative and positive correlations respectively, with data points scattered around a trendline. Finally, a ρ of 0 suggests no linear correlation, with points randomly distributed. Understanding correlation is crucial in vision models, particularly when analyzing feature dependencies or assessing the relationship between predicted and actual values."}`: The URL of the image.

You can send images in a [base64 encoded format](base64-image.md), too. For example:
