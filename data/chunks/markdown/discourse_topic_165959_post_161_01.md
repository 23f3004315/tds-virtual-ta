**: [Post #161](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/165959/161)

@s.anand sir,

I don’t understand this error. In the website, the movie name doesn’t have a colon “:”, but in the result it is expecting so.

Kraven: The Hunter'. Actual: '11. Kraven the Hunter'." This indicates a discrepancy between the expected "title" value during data validation and the actual value found in the sourced data for the 10th record, pointing to a potential data quality issue or validation logic error.
