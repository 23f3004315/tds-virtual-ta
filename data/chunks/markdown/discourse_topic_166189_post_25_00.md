Hi Satish,

Your last submitted score is the only valid score. You have to check before submitting that the score is correct. There is a reload button to load previous answers. But some answers require a live service. If the live service is not running at the time of the check (when you hit the submit button), you will not be scored for those questions. Please make sure that you have any live services running when the submit button is used and check that the last saved score is correct.

Kind regards
