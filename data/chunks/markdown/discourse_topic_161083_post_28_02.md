The actual GA questions are on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ via the seek portal or

on the Tools in Data Science introduction page.

Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs.

As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score.

We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser.

Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. @s.anand will be able to confirm the reason for this problem.

**For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly.**

Kind regards
