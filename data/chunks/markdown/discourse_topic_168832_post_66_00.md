## Post #66 by 21f3002158

Hello @carlton / @Saransh_Saini

I am Gudivada Abiram(21f3002158). In my todayâ€™s ROE exam I forgot to click the save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required.

I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other questions for extra marks.

Could you please consider my request?

Thank you.
