 there were two tasks.

Find the answer to the question
Enable the `disabled` text block

In this question, what will the answer type be?

Should it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block

MORE THAN ONE FILE
Some questions have more than one file. For example, the last question of GA5, it has a png file in this link **[Discussion Image by 23f2000573]** This image is a collection of cityscape images, likely AI-generated, depicting futuristic urban environments with glowing buildings, elevated roadways, and flying vehicles, used for visual context on a discussion forum. The discussion thread, "Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread," relates to a technical project, perhaps involving simulation or problem-solving within a futuristic setting. The images likely serve as inspiration or a visual representation of the environment the students are working with in their TDS Solver project. Given the content, the post is more likely student-generated. and a table.

In this case, how will the curl request be? Is it some thing like this

`curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
 -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
 -F "question=question text" \
 -F "file= Image file" \
 -F "file= table file/ string" 
`
CORS HEADERS
Will the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different?
