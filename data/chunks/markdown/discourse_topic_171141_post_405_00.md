Yes,the Same case happend to me also we have put lot of efforts in this project but after seeing that in mail you have no mit licence, I added that license but with name of mit license actually to just name that license file as MIT license but due to this all our hardwork is just an experience but actually we are not awarding any marks in project1 . I request the TDS team to consider this issue.
