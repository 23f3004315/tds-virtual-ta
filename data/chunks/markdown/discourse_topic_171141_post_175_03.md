Sir , I received the mail today regarding project 1 TDS scores and I have been marked fail because my repo is not public , and no docker file , no licence . but they all are present in my repo , and it is public too , , i am attaching the screenshot , you can see that too ,

My email is 23f1000598@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
