OS (C:) > Users > hsent > hello_world. The directory contains several files including ".git" (a folder), "app.py" (a Python source file), "Dockerfile", "LICENSE", "README.md", and "requirements.txt", all dated February 16, 2025. This suggests a common project structure, possibly cloned from a Git repository and including a Python application setup with a Dockerfile and dependency management. The student may be sharing this view to ask a question about project setup, dependency management, or general project structure." data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/kpyOJTQ8silacxhloviYc9zXUVH.png?dl=1" title="image" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">**[Discussion Image by HARISH.S]** This image captures a student's file directory structure within the "hello_world" project, which is part of the TDS LLM-based Automation Agent Project 1 discussion.

The path displayed is "This PC > OS (C:) > Users > hsent > hello_world", indicating the project's location. The directory contains files such as ".git", "app" (a Python source file), "Dockerfile", "LICENSE", "README" (Markdown), and "requirements" (Text Document), which are commonly found in software projects. This image is likely shared by a student needing help in navigating or understanding this project structure, as part of a troubleshooting discussion related to the LLM-based Automation Agent project. The student is potentially sharing the contents of their project directory to provide context for their question within the discussion thread., **[Discussion Image by HARISH.S]** This image, posted by HARISH.S in the TDS "Project 1" discussion thread, appears to be a student sharing their project directory structure for a "hello_world" project. The screenshot shows a Windows file explorer window, navigated to `This PC > OS (C:) > Users > hsent > hello_world`, displaying the project's contents. The directory includes standard files such as `.git`, `app.py`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, and `requirements.txt`. This probably reflects a standard setup for a Python-based project using Docker, suggesting the student is seeking confirmation on correct project setup or debugging related issues. This may elicit peer discussion or instructor guidance on coding style, Docker configuration, or dependency management. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by HARISH.S]** This image depicts a student's file explorer window, seemingly as part of a question or demonstration in the TDS "Project 1" discussion. The file path shows "This PC > OS (C:) > Users > hsent > hello_world," indicating the location of the project files. Visible files and folders include ".git," "app" (a Python source file), "Dockerfile," "LICENSE," "README," and "requirements" (a text document), which are all essential elements for a typical software project. This suggests the student might be inquiring about the structure of the project or facing issues related to these specific files. The student might be using this to ask about how to properly configure their project file structure or what contents should exist in these files. 2x" data-dominant-color="1E1F1F">image1918Ã—1078 187 KB
