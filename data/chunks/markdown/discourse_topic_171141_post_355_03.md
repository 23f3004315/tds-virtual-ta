**[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image depicts the grading output for a student's project submission, indicating a peer discussion based on discrepancies in scoring. The report shows the submitted GitHub and Docker repository links, along with prerequisite checks that all passed (receiving a '1' for each). A table displays scores for various task sections A1-A10, B1-B10, and C1-C5, all of which are currently '0'. The "task score" is 0, while "bonus" and "P1 score" are both 1. A note explains that evaluation logs are provided only if the API service started within 5 minutes, otherwise only docker logs are available, implying potential issues with API startup leading to the zero task score and prompting student questions. a score of 0, further confirming the 0 task score. The message at the bottom indicates that an evaluation log is included only if the API service started within 5 minutes, otherwise only a Docker log will be provided." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="p4Gtp6UGhC7NKXFdAngZUi3avUy" width="690" height="384" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image shows the results of a student's Project 1 submission, including pre-requisite checks, task scores, and links to the submitted GitHub and Docker repositories. The pre-requisite checks confirm that the Docker and GitHub repositories are public and were created before February 18th, and that the GitHub repository includes a LICENSE or LICENSE.md file and a Dockerfile. The student received a task score of 0, a bonus of 1, and a P1 score of 1, with all cells in the A, B, and C grids showing a value of '0'. The evaluation indicates that the student's API service did not start working within 5 minutes, and therefore they likely only have a Docker log attached., **[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image represents the automated grading output for a student's submission in the TDS course, specifically Project 1, likely a peer discussion around discrepancies. The output provides links to the submitted GitHub and Docker repositories (https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent, 23f2001390/lImagent), followed by a pre-requisites check, verifying that the Docker and GitHub repos exist, are public, and have the required LICENSE and Dockerfile. The rest of the output is a matrix of "0" values from A1 to C5 and then evaluation metrics: task score (0), bonus (1), and P1 score (1), indicating that most automated checks failed but the student received a bonus and P1 score. The output also notes that evaluation logs are attached only if the API service started within 5 minutes; otherwise, only Docker logs are provided. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image represents an automated evaluation result for a student's Project 1 submission in a TDS course, displaying a breakdown of their score and prerequisite checks. The submission includes links to the student's Github and Docker repositories, with both repositories passing initial checks for existence, public visibility, timestamp (before Feb 18th), presence of a LICENSE file (MIT license), and a Dockerfile. The score breakdown shows a "task score" of 0, a "bonus" of 1, and a "P1 score" of 1, while the evaluation matrix contains various '0' values across categories A1-A10, B1-B10, and C1-C5, likely indicating failure in those specific tests/tasks. Finally, a note indicates that only students whose API service started within 5 minutes will receive an evaluation log in addition to the Docker log. 2x" data-dominant-color="F8F8F9">image1315×732 45.7 KB
