**[Discussion Image by Atimanas]** This image depicts a student, Atimanas, filling out a form for the TDS Project 1, specifically providing a GitHub repository link and the DockerHub image name. The GitHub link provided is "https://github.com/Atimanas-Biswal421/proj1". However, there is an error message, "Must match pattern", displayed below the DockerHub image name field, suggesting the input "atimanasbiswal/proj1-tds:final" doesn't conform to the expected format, which is "user-name/image-name", possibly because of the ":final" tag at the end. The student is likely seeking clarification or troubleshooting help regarding the required DockerHub image name format.as "https://github.com/Atimanas-Biswal421/proj1". Subsequently, the form asks for the DockerHub image name, and Atimanas enters "atimanasbiswal/proj1-tds:final", which triggers an error message "Must match pattern", indicating that the provided DockerHub image name does not conform to the expected format of "user-name/image-name". The student is likely confused about the correct DockerHub image naming convention, as the inclusion of ":final" is causing a pattern mismatch. The student needs to modify DockerHub image name for validation." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-15 101818" data-base62-sha1="eYUwMQMGVSkTHB8Q1rchZjfsJmO" width="690" height="418" data-dominant-color="F6F4F7">Screenshot 2025-02-15 101818858Ã—521 24.4 KB
