**[Discussion Image by 23F3002987_J_SRI_BAL]** This image depicts a student's deployed application endpoint within the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion. The URL `vercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-projects-ec088a33.vercel.app/api?name="dzPtdczl9"` suggests the student is using Vercel for deployment and passing a "name" parameter via the query string to their API. The browser displays a JSON response: `{"marks":[65]}`, indicating the API is returning a student's mark based on the provided name. This represents either the correct output or a specific debugging step in response to a question within the discussion thread. The student is likely verifying the API endpoint's functionality after deployment.(based on the Vercel project URL), is accessing an API deployed on Vercel, with the specific URL being `vercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-projects-ec088a33.vercel.app/api?name="dzPtdczl9"`. The API endpoint, when queried with the name "dzPtdczl9", returns a JSON response `{"marks":[65]}`, indicating a successful API call and data retrieval. This suggests the student is testing an API that returns marks based on an input name, implying a functional deployment. The use of "Pretty-print" suggests that the student has an extension or setting enabled in their browser to format the JSON output for better readability. This is most likely part of a peer discussion, with a student showing their working API endpoint." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="wRV6o4y6tBfgJvvGJ0a96wE7kAe" width="690" height="193" data-dominant-color="F1F1F3">image788×221 9.73 KB
