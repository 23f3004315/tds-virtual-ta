Please extend the deadline please. 
**[Discussion Image by TheVishal]** The image posted by TheVishal in the TDS student discussion "Just some background test" shows a cat standing on its hind legs with its front paws held together near its mouth, as if in prayer or deep thought. The cat is a Scottish Fold with grey and white fur and is standing on a wooden floor. This appears to be a test post likely meant to assess the functionality of image uploads and background display within the discussion forum, rather than a technical question or problem-solving scenario. The image serves as a visual element without any direct implications for troubleshooting or learning guidance related to technical issues.ogether near its mouth, giving it a pleading or thoughtful expression. This appears to be a test post to check background image uploading functionality. The image content is not related to technical debugging or troubleshooting." alt="88394c0c2e80a1326cfffe020684be4a" data-base62-sha1="h121afIIBiw80GQnTpkJE1e94LF" width="480" height="270">88394c0c2e80a1326cfffe020684be4a480Ã—270 10.3 KB
