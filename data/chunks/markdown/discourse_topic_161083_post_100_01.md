**[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image depicts a student's attempt to use a "JSON Hash" tool, showing a large block of text resembling a garbled JSON object in a text area, followed by a "Hash" button. After clicking the button, the tool displays an error message: "Error: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 1 (line 1 column 2)". This indicates a parsing issue with the provided JSON input. The student is likely trying to generate a hash from a JSON string, but the input is not correctly formatted, lacking proper key-value structure or proper syntax, causing the parser to fail early in processing. This is likely a student question regarding how to properly format their JSON input.to valid JSON, such as a key-value pair enclosed in curly braces, before generating the hash. This is a student question showing a common JSON parsing error due to malformed input." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-24 184222" data-base62-sha1="7SvvXscGFxnWNcklT1oqIeK4d6x" width="690" height="274" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image shows a student's attempt to validate a JSON hash using a "Hash" button in a development tool, likely for the TDS Jan 2025 course. The student has entered a long string of key-value pairs, seemingly trying to hash them as JSON. However, upon clicking the "Hash" button, an error message appears: "Error: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 1 (line 1 column 2)". This indicates the input string is not valid JSON because it's missing enclosing curly braces or square brackets and proper JSON formatting (e.g., `"key": "value"`). The student is thus facing a common beginner's challenge of constructing valid JSON syntax. The issue isn't necessarily the hash algorithm itself, but that the input provided is not recognizable as a JSON object or array., **[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image depicts a student's attempt to use a "JSON Hash" tool, likely within a development environment or exercise during the TDS Jan 2025 "GA1 - Development Tools" course, along with an error message. The student has entered a string of key-value pairs into the text area (e.g., "ybCLb85bY2, aNbP76ziv: SBOOK1, 4x5UK: Ee"). After clicking the "Hash" button, the tool displays the error message: "Error: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 1 (line 1 column 2)." This indicates that the input provided is not valid JSON because the entire input string should be enclosed in curly braces "{}" to be a valid JSON object, and each key-value pair should use a colon ":" instead of a comma "," to separate keys from values within the JSON object. The student likely needs to reformat the input as valid JSON to generate a hash. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image shows a student's attempt to use a "JSON Hash" tool, likely within a development environment, resulting in an error. The student has entered a long string of what appears to be key-value pairs (though not properly formatted) into a text area labeled "JSON Hash". Upon clicking the "Hash" button, the tool produces the error message: "Error: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 1 (line 1 column 2)". The issue stems from the invalid JSON format; the entered text is not a valid JSON object, likely missing curly braces `{}` to enclose the entire structure and using incorrect delimiters or missing quotes around keys. This suggests the student needs to learn or review the correct JSON syntax to use the tool effectively. 2x" data-dominant-color="ECDEDF">Screenshot 2025-01-24 1842222677Ã—1066 294 KB
