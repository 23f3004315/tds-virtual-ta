Hi @carlton @Jivraj

I might have found a bug in my code, I have hardcoded my file directory into my code but I didnâ€™t change it later. I have created a safe_open function that will throw a HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN error when tried to access files outside that directory. Because of this all the tasks failed. There also might be environment and configuration issues in my Dockerfile. When I tested locally, it worked fine but because of this small mistake I am now only getting 1/20. Is it possible to change/modify my code?

Thanks for considering, any help would be appreciated. Worked very hard for this
