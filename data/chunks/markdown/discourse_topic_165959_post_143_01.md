**[Discussion Image by 23f2005138]** This image is a code snippet posted within a student discussion about GA4 data sourcing in the TDS Jan 2025 course. It shows an example of a JSON-formatted list containing movie data, with each movie object including fields such as "id", "title", "year", and "rating", and includes the comment "// ... more titles" to indicate that the list is truncated. The students are likely discussing how to process or format data in this structure, and it represents a peer discussion showing the kind of data students are trying to work with. The example provides a clear structure and data types that are under discussion.a student sharing a sample data structure or an instructor providing an example response for a data sourcing task. The JSON array contains movie objects; each object has keys for ID (e.g., "tt1234567"), title (e.g., "Movie 1"), year (e.g., 2021), and rating (e.g., 5.8). The "// ... more titles" indicates that the shown data is an excerpt from a larger dataset. The student's question in the thread likely pertains to formatting, parsing, or handling data of this structure when integrating it with GA4." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="w0qhoG79dszeK1RqTxmlkJOsvWD" width="690" height="85" data-dominant-color="11161C">image1580×196 4.81 KB
