**[Discussion Image by 23f2003751]** This image depicts the result of a student's API call, likely a demonstration or validation step in a deployment exercise. The URL in the browser address bar shows a Vercel deployment URL: "student-marks-gb9zwxnfx-tushars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/api?name=IjJOGavw&name=Ry2N2zqyxV". The "Pretty-print" option is enabled, indicating that the JSON output is formatted for readability. The JSON response body shown in the browser window is: `{"marks": [65, 74]}`, suggesting the API endpoint successfully returned a list of student marks, confirming successful deployment and API functionality. This is likely a student sharing successful output to a peer or instructor, to demonstrate that the student's deployment and API are functional.ars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/api?name=IjJOGavw&name=Ry2N2zqyxV` indicates the application is hosted on Vercel. The JSON response shows the data structure with a key "marks" holding an array of numerical values: `[65, 74]`. The "Pretty-print" checkbox in the browser suggests the JSON output has been formatted for readability, indicating successful API data retrieval and display. This post provides evidence that the student is able to successfully deploy and test their application by inspecting the data returned from the API endpoint." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="mwhQGQIqgYLzFxtIy698gpZFrax" width="690" height="115" data-dominant-color="2B2A2A">image1065Ã—178 7.32 KB
