What does it mean to solve the question?

Everyone is asking that?

Do you yourself know what to do and to go about it?

Or just pull out something from your hAtSS at the last moment?

“and responds with the answer to enter in the assignment.”

From my understanding only those questions that are solved with a program and give an answer are to be considered… For example it states in the project that

" The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: `answer` that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example:"

If you all still have not responded, then I’m honestly not sure if this is what y’all meant.

Last project was not clear to some extent, This time its even more vague.
