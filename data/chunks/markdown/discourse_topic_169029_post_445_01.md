**[Discussion Image by 23f3001764]** This image depicts a student's interaction with the TDS solver project within Postman. The student is sending a POST request to `https://tds-pro...`, and the UI displays the request setup with tabs for Params, Authorization, Headers, Body, etc. The body of the request, viewed in JSON format via the "Pretty" and "JSON" tabs, shows `{"answer": "140"}`. The response received shows a "Status: 200 OK" message, with a time of 53.13 seconds and a size of 361 B, indicating a successful request, although the long response time might raise concern about server performance.
