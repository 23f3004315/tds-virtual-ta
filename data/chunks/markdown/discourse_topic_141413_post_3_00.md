TDS ROE is a reality check on your true skills. Rather than face FAANG type tests when it really matters and get a shock that you are at the bottom of the pile, it is better you face reality now in an environment that does not unduly penalises you.

This situation is causing CGPAs to drop significantly.

While that seems like a nice sound bite, letâ€™s look at the data as true data scientists rather than let emotion lead our thoughts.

If you get an S in TDS, its weight to your total Diploma CGPA will be 5.55%.

When you consider that ROE is worth 20% of that, the overall effect on your diploma CGPA at BEST is 1.11% if you score 100% in it. The TRUE effect **is lower** if you take into consideration you can offset at least 25% of that loss with bonus questions (worth 5% of the TDS grade)!
