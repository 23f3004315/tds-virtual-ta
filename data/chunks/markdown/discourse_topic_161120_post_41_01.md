 the last part is not applicable as the image was not processed ). Visually, I could not find any difference between the two files and the size of new file is less than 1,500 bytes.

Tried through Chrome v132.0.6834.83 without any add-ons/extensions.

**[Discussion Image by 23f2005138]** This image depicts a student encountering an error while attempting to upload an image as part of the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" assignment. The upload form specifies that the image should be losslessly compressed and less than 1,500 bytes. The student selected the "shapes_compressed.png" file using the "Choose File" button, but received the error message: "Could not process image. Is it a browser-supported image? Image pixels do not match the original." This suggests a potential issue with the image format, corruption, or pixel modification during compression or handling by the browser. The student is facing a technical issue preventing them from completing the image upload step.ent has selected "shapes_compressed.png" for upload via the "Choose File" button. However, an error message appears stating: "Could not process image. Is it a browser-supported image? Image pixels do not match the original." This suggests that either the image format is not supported by the browser's image processing capabilities, or the image has been modified after lossless compression, resulting in pixel mismatches compared to the original image data. The student is likely facing challenges in fulfilling the image upload requirements due to image compatibility or potential corruption during processing or compression." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="p2NbPPDofwu8EUpVLGQeBVtVZnc" width="690" height="129" data-dominant-color="2F2F33">image830Ã—156 10.3 KB
