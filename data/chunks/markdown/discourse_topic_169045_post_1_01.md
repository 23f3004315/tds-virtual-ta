# Requested format
## Student Assignments Directory Structure

---

Each student has a folder named with their roll number. Inside each student's folder, there are multiple assignment folders (`Assignment_X`). Each assignment contains:
- A `.txt` file with the question statement.
- A corresponding `.py`, `.sh`, or `.js` file for the solution.

### Example Directory Structure
RollNo_12345/
├── Assignment_1/
│ ├── Q1.txt # Question for Q1
│ ├── Q1.py # Solution in Python
│ ├── Q2.txt # Question for Q2
│ ├── Q2.sh # Solution in Bash
│ ├── Q3.txt # Question for Q3
│ ├── Q3.js # Solution in JavaScript
├── Assignment_2/
