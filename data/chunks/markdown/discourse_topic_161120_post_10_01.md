**[Discussion Image by 22f2001640]** This image captures a student's troubleshooting experience during deployment, specifically displaying an ngrok error encountered while attempting to tunnel traffic to a local web service. The error message "ERR_NGROK_8012" indicates that while the tunneling to the ngrok agent was successful, the agent failed to connect to the upstream web service at `http://localhost:8080`. The specific error reported is "dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused", suggesting the local web service wasn't running or accessible. The page provides guidance, advising the developer to ensure a web service is running on `http://localhost:8080` and to test the connection using cURL or a browser. This content would assist students facing similar ngrok connectivity issues by directing them to check the status and accessibility of their local web service. or opening the address in a browser to verify connectivity. This likely represents a student facing difficulty in getting ngrok to correctly tunnel to their local development server, prompting them to share the error within the discussion thread." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="wmAAY4gaAeOiTPvGoYgoFFq7j6K" width="690" height="318" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f2001640]** This image depicts a troubleshooting scenario within a student discussion about deployment tools, specifically related to ngrok in the TDS Jan 2025 cohort.

As a diagnostic step, it is also shows that it is showing the connection path: Internet -> ngrok Edge -> ngrok Agent -> Your Service (marked with an X)., **[Discussion Image by 22f2001640]** This image depicts a common error encountered when using ngrok, representing a troubleshooting discussion point in a student forum. The error message, `ERR_NGROK_8012`, indicates that while the traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, the agent failed to establish a connection with the upstream web service at `http://localhost:8080`. The specific error encountered was "dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused," suggesting that no service was listening on port 8080 on the local machine, or that a firewall might be blocking the connection. The interface visually indicates the failure in the connection path: Internet -> ngrok Edge -> ngrok Agent (marked with a red 'X') -> Your Service. The instructions on the page prompt the user to ensure a web service is running at `http://localhost:8080` on the machine where the ngrok agent is running, suggesting a check with `curl` or a browser, to verify correct responses. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f2001640]** This image shows a screenshot of a troubleshooting error message within the context of a student discussion about deployment tools, specifically ngrok, and represents a student's question. The error, ERR_NGROK_8012, indicates that while traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, the agent failed to connect to the upstream web service at `http://localhost:8080`, with the specific error `dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused`. The page also suggests checking that a web service is running on the machine where the ngrok agent is running at the specified address, instructing the user to try `cURL` or open the address in a browser to check the response, and to refer to the ngrok documentation. The student is likely facing issues with the application not being accessible through ngrok due to connectivity problems between the ngrok agent and the local web service. 2x" data-dominant-color="F3F4F5">image1920Ã—886 45.7 KB
