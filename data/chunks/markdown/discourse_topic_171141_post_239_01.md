**[Discussion Image by Vedant22]** This image shows the results of Project 1 prerequisite evaluations, indicating a student's submission failing to meet the minimum requirements, leading to a score of 0. The evaluations check for the presence and public accessibility of the Docker image in Docker Hub and the GitHub repository, as well as the existence of a Dockerfile and MIT license in the root of the GitHub repo. Here, the Docker image check failed, but the other checks passed. The image also contains the command `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`, which is likely how the Docker image should be run. The text emphasizes that submissions not meeting minimum requirements will not be evaluated.ll prevent evaluation. This represents an instructor's feedback on a student submission, identifying where the student did not meet requirements." alt="IMG_7078" data-base62-sha1="9cVv4NyVXvwIVWEBlYSIuNPvtiN" width="394" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Vedant22]** This image shows the automated evaluation results for a student's Project 1 submission, specifically the prerequisite checks, indicating a potential grading issue. The evaluation checks whether the Docker image is present and public on Docker Hub, if the Github repository is present and public, and if the Dockerfile and MIT license are present in the root of the Github repository. The results show that the Docker image is NOT present/public on Docker Hub (FAIL), but the Github repository, Dockerfile, and MIT License checks passed successfully. Consequently, the prerequisites have failed, resulting in a Project 1 score of 0. The instructions mention running the image using a `podman run` command with environment variables and port mapping, and emphasize the Docker image should use the same Dockerfile from the Github repo., **[Discussion Image by Vedant22]** This image is part of a peer discussion where a student is likely troubleshooting issues with their Project 1 submission. The image shows a list of Project 1 prerequisite evaluations, highlighting that the "Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public" check has failed, while checks for the GitHub repository being present and public, the Dockerfile being in the root of the GitHub repository, and the MIT license being present in the root of the GitHub repository have all passed. Because one of the prerequisites has failed, the overall prerequisite check fails, and the Project 1 score is 0. The text also includes a reminder that the Docker image should use the same Dockerfile as the one in the GitHub repository. The image provides a specific `podman run` command: `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Vedant22]** This image shows feedback from the Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations in a student discussion. The checks indicate that the student's GitHub repository is present and public, with the Dockerfile and MIT license in the root directory both passing the evaluations. However, the evaluation "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public" failed. Because of this, the student's project prerequisites failed, resulting in a Project 1 score of 0, indicating that the submission will likely not be evaluated due to not meeting the requirements. The image also includes an important instruction: that the Docker image must use the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository, and the `podman run` command to verify the container is running correctly ( `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`). 2x" data-dominant-color="333437">IMG_7078828Ã—1049 164 KB
