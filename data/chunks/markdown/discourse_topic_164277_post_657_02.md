**[Discussion Image by thinkmachine]** This image depicts a snippet of a table showing GitHub repository information, likely as part of a student's troubleshooting process during the LLM-based Automation Agent project. The table has columns labeled "Last Pushed," "Contains," and "Visibility," showing data for two repositories. The first repository was last pushed about 2 hours ago, contains an image, and has "Public" visibility, with "Public" circled in red highlighting this setting. The second repository was last pushed 2 months ago, also contains an image, and is "Public," indicating that both repositories are currently publicly accessible on GitHub. This visual confirmation suggests a student might be ensuring their project repository is public as part of the project requirements or to allow for easier collaboration/review.ion. It shows two entries in a table with columns: "Last Pushed", "Contains", and "Visibility". The first entry indicates that the repository was last pushed "about 2 hours ago", "Contains" an image, and has "Public" visibility, which is circled in red to highlight it. The second entry shows the repository was last pushed "2 months ago", also "Contains" an image, and is also "Public". The context suggests a student is confirming their repository is public, based on the "Visibility" column details and the most recent push timing." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="xKjkSm5LcRMcqZCkcM5M1idqlp1" width="439" height="204">image439×204 7.25 KB
