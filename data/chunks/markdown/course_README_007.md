### Notes

---

- **[Graded Assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1) checks course pre-requisites**. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now.
- â€¡ **Graded Assignments: Best 4 out 7**. We'll take the best 4 out of your graded assignments submissions. These, combined, will have a 15% weightage.
- **Remote exams are open and hard**
 - You can use the Internet, WhatsApp, ChatGPT, your notes, your friends, your pets...
 - The RoE is especially hard. Read: [What is the purpose of an impossible RoE exam?](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/whats-the-actual-purpose-of-impossible-roe-exam/99838/2)
- **Final exam is in-person and closed book**. It tests your memory. It's easy.
- **Projects test application**. The projects test how well you apply what you learnt in a real-world context.
- **Bonus activities may be posted on Discourse**. See [previous bonus activities](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/tags/c/courses/tds-kb/34/bonus-marks)
- **Evaluations are mostly automated**. This course uses pre-computed (for objective) or LLMs (for subjective) evaluations.
 - LLMs will evaluate you differently each time. Learn to prompt them _robustly_ to get higher marks.
