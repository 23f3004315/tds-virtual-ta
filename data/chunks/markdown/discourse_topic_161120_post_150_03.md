**[Discussion Image by 21f3000745]** This image depicts a student question during a TDS "Deployment Tools" discussion, likely an assessment or lab exercise, where the student is asked to provide their Vercel URL, which should follow the pattern "https://your-app.vercel.app/api". The student entered "https://new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api", but upon clicking the "Check" button, they received an error message. The error indicates a mismatch in expected data, with the system anticipating an array of numbers "[98,92,56,72,17]" but receiving "[48, "Not Found", "Not Found", "Not Found", "Not Found"]", suggesting a problem with the entered URL or the server's response at that endpoint. The student is facing a problem related to incorrect Vercel URL configuration or deployment that causes the server to respond with a "Not Found" message when the test attempts to check the endpoint.. The student has entered `https://new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api` in the input field, but upon clicking the "Check" button, an error message appears, indicating a mismatch between the expected data and the actual result. The error "Expected [98,92,56,72,17] but got [48,"Not Found","Not Found","Not Found","Not Found"]" suggests that the provided URL is not returning the expected response or data, potentially due to a missing or incorrect endpoint or issues with the deployment itself. The numbers likely represent an expected ASCII array, but the response is an array of "Not Found" elements. This indicates that the `/api` endpoint on the Vercel deployment is not correctly configured or accessible." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="eWQCVWJyDvvuf54fI4O55Nt1dSW" width="690" height="191" data-dominant-color="F7F3F6">image837Ã—232 10.8 KB
