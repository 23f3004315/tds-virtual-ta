**[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image captures a code snippet shared by an instructor to help students verify Google Colab access within the "Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread." The Python code utilizes libraries like `hashlib`, `requests`, `google.colab.auth`, and `oauth2client.client` to authenticate a user, retrieve their email address, and then generate a 5-character SHA256 hash based on the email and token expiry year. The code first authenticates via `auth.authenticate_user()`, obtains access credentials and a token, fetches user info from a Google API endpoint (`https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo`), extracts the email address, and calculates the hash with `hashlib.sha256`. The expected result is a 5-character string, suggesting a specific output verification or data transformation is involved.oken expiry year, finally extracting the last 5 characters of the hash. The student's question at the end prompts for the expected output, which should be a 5-character string." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="ymcWU7UTGVLYFdgwWIEAFSxjWsJ" width="690" height="236" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image depicts a code snippet shared in a student discussion thread, specifically related to verifying Google Colab access for a TDS project, likely Project 2 involving a TDS solver. The provided Python code aims to retrieve user email information via Google's OAuth2 API and then compute a 5-character SHA256 hash based on the email and token expiry year. The code first imports necessary libraries (hashlib, requests, google.colab.auth, oauth2client), authenticates the user using `auth.authenticate_user()`, gets Google credentials and an access token, retrieves the user's email from the Google API, and finally calculates the hash. The post concludes with a question about the expected result of the hash calculation, noting it should be a 5-character string. This is likely an instructor-provided code snippet and question intended to guide students in ensuring they have correct access to Google Colab and its resources for the assignment., **[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image shows a code snippet shared in the TDS "Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread" to help students verify Google Colab access. The code imports libraries like hashlib and requests, authenticates the user with Google Colab using `google.colab.auth`, retrieves the user's email, and computes a SHA256 hash based on the email and token expiry year. The student is prompted to run this code and check if the result is a 5-character string, suggesting it is a verification step for a project dependency. The code includes a request to the Google API to obtain user info, further solidifying its purpose for authentication and verification. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image captures a code snippet posted in the "Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread". The post provides a Python script designed to verify access to Google Colab using the student's IITM email ID. The script utilizes libraries like `hashlib`, `requests`, `google.colab.auth`, and `oauth2client` to authenticate the user, retrieve an access token, and fetch the user's email address from the Google API. It then calculates a SHA256 hash of the email and the token's expiry year, extracting the last 5 characters of the hexadecimal digest. The post concludes by asking for the result, specifying that it should be a 5-character string, indicating the expected output of the provided code. 2x" data-dominant-color="3D4046">image1613Ã—554 32.9 KB
