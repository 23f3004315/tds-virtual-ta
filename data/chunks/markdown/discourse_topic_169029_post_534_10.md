The user has navigated to the `process_request_api_post` endpoint documentation on Azure, specifically `https://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs#/default/process_request_api_post`. The documentation provides a sample CURL command to make a request, which includes the 'question' parameter asking for the GitHub Pages URL, with a suggested format. The screenshot displays a successful server response with a 200 status code and a JSON response body containing the answer: `"answer": "https://shashikumarkohir.github.io/my-portfolio/"`. The response headers also show the `access-control-allow-origin` set to the Azure app domain, `content-type` as `application/json` and server as `nginx/1.24.0 (Ubuntu)`.eal the server is running nginx/1.24.0 on Ubuntu, and the content type is application/json.
