**[Discussion Image by 21f3003255]** This image shows a "Recent saves" section, likely from a game or application with save functionality, and it is part of a student discussion on deployment tools. It lists three saved states with details including a "Reload" button, date and time of the save (02/02/2025 at 18:21:07, 18:20:57, and 16:45:08), and a score associated with each save (10, 10, and 8.5, respectively). The image provides context for a student's question or discussion point about saving and reloading states in the context of deployment tools for their GA2 assignment. By displaying the game's save functionality, the student is setting the scene for whatever issue they might be encountering with saving/reloading, possibly related to how they are deploying the game. This indicates a peer discussion where students are sharing UI elements from their projects to illustrate problems they are facing.lation to the deployed build." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="kanQzjCKs2dNb6HJRBFfEhnldIz" width="690" height="105" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 21f3003255]** This image captures a section of a user interface, specifically displaying "Recent saves" within the context of a TDS student discussion on deployment tools. The UI shows a list of save points, each with a "Reload" button, the date and time of the save (e.g., "02/02/2025, 18:21:07"), and a corresponding score. The saves listed include entries from "02/02/2025, 18:21:07" with a score of 10, "02/02/2025, 18:20:57" with a score of 10, and "02/02/2025, 16:45:08" with a score of 8.5. This UI element likely enables users to revert to previous states of an application or game being developed or tested, as part of the deployment and testing process. The discussion context suggests the students are likely troubleshooting deployment or save state issues., **[Discussion Image by 21f3003255]** This image depicts the "Recent saves" section of a game or application, likely related to a student's deployment project for GA2. The UI shows a list of save entries, each displaying a "Reload" button, the date and time of the save (e.g., "02/02/2025, 18:21:07"), and a corresponding score (e.g., "Score: 10"). Two recent saves have a score of 10, while an older save has a score of 8.5. This suggests the student is iterating on their project, potentially trying to improve their score or performance, and using the save/reload functionality for quick testing and evaluation. The "Reload" button indicates a means to revert to a specific state of the application or game. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 21f3003255]** This image shows a UI section labeled "Recent saves" within a TDS student discussion. The UI displays a list of saved game states, with each entry including a "Reload" button, the date and time of the save (e.g., "02/02/2025, 18:21:07"), and a score associated with that save (e.g., "Score: 10"). There are three save entries displayed: two saves with a score of 10 and a third, older save with a score of 8.5. The "Reload" button suggests the user can revert to any of these previous states. The context likely pertains to debugging, testing, or replaying sections within a game or application during the deployment tools module. 2x" data-dominant-color="112019">image2762Ã—424 36.3 KB
