**[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image shows a student's project evaluation log file, indicating errors during automated testing. It displays a series of failed test cases, specifically "B9 FAILED" and "B10 FAILED" due to the system's inability to read files located at `/data/b9.html` and `/data/b10.csv`, evidenced by "Cannot read" error messages. The log also contains an HTTP 400 error which indicates a "Bad Request" when running a datasette with a complex query to count bronze ticket types, potentially due to connection refusal on port 8001 when trying to access the `/ticket-sales.csv` endpoint and subsequently failing to establish a new connection, suggesting the datasette server might not be running correctly or accessible. The student's score is displayed as 7/20, highlighting the incomplete solution and need for troubleshooting the server connection and file read operations. The final HTTP request in the log to the openai embedding server was successful.e task involves querying the ticket-sales.db database to count "Bronze" type entries and save the result to /data/b10.csv, then stopping the datasette server, and the errors suggest problems in both the data processing and server management parts of the task, ultimately resulting in a low score of 7/20." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="6NrbGjttDAtAU7aWm5jII996wPO" width="690" height="348" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image captures error logs from a student's attempt to complete a task in an assignment, specifically related to project 1, showing troubleshooting during development. The logs indicate failures in reading files ("B9 failed: Cannot read /data/b9.html" and "B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv") and an HTTP 400 Bad Request error when trying to run a datasette via 'uvx datasette' with a query to count rows from the "tickets" table where the type is "Bronze." The error message "Connection refused" suggests the datasette server was not running or accessible at the expected address and port (localhost:8001). This caused a failure to save the results to `/data/b10.csv`, leading to the B10 task failing with a score of 7/20., **[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image captures the error log of a student's attempt at project execution, likely TDS Project 1, showing a mix of task setup, HTTP requests, and failures. The log reveals the student is trying to run a datasette on `ticket-sales.db` to count the number of tickets with "Bronze" type, saving the result to `/data/b10.csv`. Multiple errors occur: `B9 failed: Cannot read /data/b9.html`, a `400 Bad Request` during the datasette setup, and a `Connection refused` error indicating the datasette server couldn't be reached. The subsequent `GET` request for `/data/b10.csv` fails with `404 Not Found` because the previous steps didn't correctly generate the file, leading to task `B10` failing and the student scoring 7/20. The root cause seems to be the inability to correctly start the datasette server or connect to it, preventing data processing and file creation. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image shows a student's error log during an automated project evaluation, indicating issues with running a datasette server and accessing data. The log highlights two main problems: B9 failed because `/data/b9.html` cannot be read, and B10 failed because `/data/b10.csv` cannot be read, likely due to HTTP 404 errors when trying to access these files. A preceding HTTP 400 "Bad Request" error, with a "Connection refused" message related to connecting to `localhost:8001`, suggests the datasette server, which is supposed to run in the background on port 8001 and serve `ticket-sales.csv`, is not accessible or running as expected, causing the subsequent file access failures. The log also includes the full HTTP request that resulted in the 400 error, showing the attempt to run a datasette instance and query it for the number of "Bronze" tickets. The student's score is 7/20 at this point, showing problems in the automated evaluation. 2x" data-dominant-color="C0C0C0">image1892Ã—955 130 KB
