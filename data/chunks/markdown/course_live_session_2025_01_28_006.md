A41:** Embeddings are another important topic. They reduce the cost of using tokens by an order of magnitude. You can download embeddings from Hugging Face. We'll demonstrate this in a future session.

**Q42: What about text extraction?**

**A42:** We'll cover this in a future session.

**Q43: What about Base64 encoding?**

---

**A43:** We'll cover this in a future session. It's how you send images to the API.

**Q44: I've seen students use the LLM to get answers to Quiz One. Can I do that?**

**A44:** Yes, you can upload a screenshot of the question and ask the LLM for the answer and explanation. You would send it as a Base64 encoded URI. We'll cover this in a future session.

**Q45: Can we simply go through the topics mentioned (prompt engineering, TDS, TA instructions, LLM sentiment analysis) during self-study?**

**A45:** Yes, but this content is simplified. Reading through documentation is difficult, so we've put this together for you. We'll also demonstrate and do working examples.

**Q46: Can we change the time of the sessions? My other classes are clashing. I've already told the TA, but haven't received a response.**

**A46:** The Wednesday session cannot be moved. The Thursday session might be possible, but the sessions are generally kept in the evening because many students work during the day. We record all sessions, so you can view them later. We can try to schedule an earlier doubt-clearing session, perhaps on Friday, but I'll have to discuss it with the team. What time on Friday works for you?
