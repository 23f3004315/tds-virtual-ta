[**[Course Image: Podman Tutorial Zero to Hero | Full 1 Hour Course]** This image promotes a video tutorial presented by Giuseppe Scaramuzzino focusing on Podman, a container management tool similar to Docker, designed for developing, managing, and running OCI containers. The tutorial aims to take learners from a beginner level ("zero") to an advanced skill level ("hero") in containerization concepts with Podman in one hour. While Docker is the primary focus of this module, understanding alternatives like Podman broadens your knowledge of containerization. Students can apply this knowledge to create, deploy, and manage containerized applications efficiently, potentially simplifying certain development workflows and improving overall understanding of container ecosystems.es Podman as an alternative to Docker, offering a comprehensive tutorial to elevate users from beginners to experts. The "Podman tutorial: from zero to hero" course aims to equip learners with the skills to effectively manage containers. Key concepts covered likely include container creation, management, and deployment, potentially focusing on the benefits and differences between Podman and Docker. Students can expect to learn how to use Podman to build, run, and share containerized applications, understanding its role in modern application development and deployment workflows. Although Podman serves a similar function to Docker, understanding Docker's fundamentals is a helpful prerequisite before delving into Podman.)](https://youtu.be/YXfA5O5Mr18)
