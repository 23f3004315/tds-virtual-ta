**[Discussion Image by 23f1002709]** This image shows a portion of a student's dashboard, specifically the area where quiz scores are displayed, and the context is peer discussion concerning the display of "Absent" for Programming Quiz 1. The student's dashboard shows the text "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - Absent", indicating that the system currently registers the student as absent for the quiz. The surrounding discussion thread addresses scenarios where a submitted quiz is incorrectly marked as absent or shows an incorrect score. This suggests that the dashboard display might not accurately reflect whether a student has taken the quiz. The peer discussion may have potential troubleshooting or resolution, but the image itself only shows the problem state of "Absent" being displayed.bout how scores are displayed in the dashboard, as they are trying to understand the label for their ROE scores. The "Absent" status suggests the student might have missed the quiz or there was an issue with its submission/grading. This likely initiated a discussion about possible reasons for the absent status and potential troubleshooting steps to resolve the discrepancy. It indicates possible confusion about the assessment status within the student dashboard's user interface." alt="Screenshot 2025-03-07 at 6.52.59 PM" data-base62-sha1="68B1F1eeZzUorGPVQq7mtqdxvNz" width="425" height="48">
