## Post #479 by 23f2000237

**Direct Link**: [Post #479](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/169029/479)

I checked my Vercel logs and saw that the requests were sent to the /api endpoint instead of the /api/ endpoint that I specifically gave in the google forms.

To confirm this I also sent a request to /api and /api/ enpoints and the /api gave a 404 error while /api/ gave a 200 message.

Please look into this
