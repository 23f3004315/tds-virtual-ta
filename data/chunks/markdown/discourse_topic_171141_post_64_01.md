**[Discussion Image by 22f2001389]** This image depicts a student's Visual Studio Code (VS Code) project structure, likely related to the TDS official project. The file explorer shows common project files like `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.gitignore`, `.env`, and Python executables. At the bottom of the VS Code window, a status message indicates "Python extension loading...", suggesting the environment is still being initialized. The "PROBLEMS" tab is visible, possibly indicating errors in the project that the student might be trying to resolve. The student seems to be navigating the project files, likely trying to debug or understand the project structure, and the ongoing Python extension loading might be a source of initial confusion or a delay in identifying errors. as `C:\Users\Ri\(tds roe)`." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="4V496m6te2DxSAFIVIfmsQkWF3x" width="281" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f2001389]** This image captures a student's VS Code environment and is likely related to a question or problem during a TDS project. The file explorer shows key files like "app.py", "datagen.py", "evaluate.py", "requirements.txt", "docker-compose.yml", and ".env", suggesting a Python project potentially using Docker. The bottom status bar shows "Python extension loading...", indicating an initialization process is ongoing, which could be the source of the problem or delay the student is experiencing. There's a "PROBLEMS" section visible which likely contains error messages. The student's current working directory is "C:\Users\Ri\(tds_roe)"., **[Discussion Image by 22f2001389]** This image shows a student's VS Code project directory structure, indicating a peer discussion or student question regarding project setup. The file list includes Python executables, Docker-related files (.dockerignore, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml), Python scripts (app.py, datagen.py, evaluate.py, tasksA.py), environment configuration files (.env, pyvenv.cfg), and requirements.txt. The explorer highlights "app.py", and a "Python extension loading..." message is visible in the status bar at the bottom, possibly indicating a dependency or environment issue. The VS Code window shows "PROBLEMS" suggesting potential errors or warnings within the project; the file path is shown as C:\Users\Ri, and the terminal is using the "(tds_roe)" environment. The student may be facing an environment setup issue or dependency problem, indicated by the "Python extension loading" message and possible "PROBLEMS." 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f2001389]** This image captures a student's VS Code IDE interface during the TDS project, showing their project file structure on the left sidebar, including files like 'app.py', 'datagen.py', 'docker-compose.yml', 'requirements.txt', and executables such as 'pip.exe' and 'python.exe', indicating a Python and Docker-based project environment. At the bottom, a "Python extension loading..." message suggests the Python extension is still initializing, possibly impacting the IDE's functionality, and the "PROBLEMS" section indicates potential issues within the project that need addressing. The student is likely working on setting up the project environment and might be facing issues due to the incomplete loading of the Python extension. The file path `C:\Users\Ri\` is visible in the PROBLEMS section and terminal window. 2x" data-dominant-color="393D3E">image2160×3840 1.92 MB
