This session is designed to build upon foundational concepts covered in the first week of the course. The visual elements, with icons representing data points, charts, coding and connections, suggest a focus on data visualization, analysis, and possibly aspects of data engineering or machine learning fundamentals. This session is a continuation of the initial week's curriculum, aiming to deepen understanding and practical application of core data science principles. By focusing on week 1 session 2, the material will likely build on prior knowledge that the students have, continuing to apply knowledge of core data science principles.sion 2" of the TDS live session from January 17, 2025. The session likely covers introductory material, indicated by the "Week 1" label. Expect fundamental concepts and skills related to the TDS course to be discussed in this session. The visual elements surrounding the text, such as graphs, charts, and connected nodes, suggest topics related to data analysis, data visualization, and potentially network analysis. This session likely lays the groundwork for subsequent, more advanced topics in the course.)](https://youtu.be/hG5WqtbpfkI)

**Q1: How to solve question number 7 (counting Wednesdays between two dates)?**

**A1:** Use Excel. Input the two dates into two cells. Use a command to find the difference in days, then divide by 7 to get the number of weeks. Since there's one Wednesday per week, that's the number of Wednesdays. If the start date isn't a Wednesday, a different approach is needed.

**Q2: How to handle dates that don't start on a Wednesday?**
