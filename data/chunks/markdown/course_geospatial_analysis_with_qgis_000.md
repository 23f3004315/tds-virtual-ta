## Geospatial Analysis with QGIS

[**[Course Image: Geospatial analysis with QGIS]** This image shows the QGIS interface after loading shapefiles for South Sudan. The "Browser" panel displays a file directory containing shapefiles (SDN_adm0.shp, SDN_adm1.shp, etc.), which represent administrative boundaries at different levels. In the "Layers" panel, several of these shapefiles, specifically "SDN_adm0", "SDN_adm1", and "SDN_adm3", are loaded and visualized in the main map view, outlining the different administrative regions. The map visualizes the geographic boundaries of South Sudan at different administrative levels using these shapefiles. Understanding how to load and display shapefiles in QGIS is essential for geospatial analysis, allowing users to visualize and analyze geographic data effectively.how to load and visualize geospatial data for South Sudan. The "Browser" panel on the left shows that shapefiles (SDN_adm0.shp, SDN_adm1.shp, etc.) representing different administrative levels are being accessed, likely from a zipped archive (SDN_adm.zip). In the "Layers" panel, different administrative boundary layers are loaded, where "SDN_adm3" is checked to be visible on the map canvas. The central map display then shows the administrative boundaries of South Sudan, visualized in red, enabling geospatial analysis and exploration of the region's geographic subdivisions. By loading and visualizing these shapefiles, you can then apply various geospatial operations available within QGIS, such as spatial queries, overlays, and thematic mapping.)](https://youtu.be/tJhehs0o-ik)
