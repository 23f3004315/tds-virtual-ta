ing the output into an input box. There's no significant technical component to this question.

**Q4: What are the benefits of using the UV command-line tool?**

**A4:** UV eliminates the need to create virtual environments. You include small portions of code and run the application with minimal setup.

**Q5: How does UV integrate with VS Code?**

---

**A5:** There's no integration; UV is used in the command prompt, similar to pip (Python), npm (JavaScript), or Node.js.

**Q6: Are there examples demonstrating UV usage and integration with VS Code?**

**A6:** No specific VS Code integration is needed. UV is used in the command line, like pip or npm. A previous project (Project 2) used UV to automate running 687 student Python submissions, each with unique requirements. Students added metadata to their Python files specifying the Python version and required libraries. UV dynamically handled these requirements for each submission.

**Q7: In the RWE exam, what will the format be like?**

**A7:** The format will be similar to the graded assignments: questions and answer boxes. You can use any tools you want. It's a non-proctored exam. It will cover concepts taught in the course, including new material.

**Q8: In Week 1, do we need to build advanced-level concepts, or will we learn them week by week?**

**A8:** Each week will have different content, including graded assignments. Content links are provided.

**Q9: The UV part of the project was only a 7-minute video. Do we need to learn UV fully in Week 1, or will we learn it in upcoming weeks?**

**A9:** UV is introduced in Week 1. The most useful aspect is embedding everything in inline metadata within the script, eliminating the need for virtual environments.

**Q10: How do we start the project?**

**A10:** There will be separate guidance sessions for the project.

**Q11: Will we get a screen recording of this session?**

**A11:** Yes, the session will be uploaded to YouTube.

**Q12: While putting in the directory for a specific file (e.g., question 2), do you need to provide the full address (drive, etc.)?**

**A12:** It works because the script is executed from the same directory. You need to provide the correct path (relative or absolute).

**Q13: Can you explain the use of DevTools?**
