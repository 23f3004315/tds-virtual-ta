/read/data/dates.txt query.

I am also able to use the count_wednesdays function through the POST/run task/count_wednesdays.

But when I am entering a query such as “count_wednesdays in data/dates.txt” I am unable to get a response.

**[Discussion Image by apanjwani]** This image, extracted from a student discussion about an LLM-based Automation Agent project, shows a troubleshooting scenario related to the agent's task understanding. Specifically, the image displays a successful HTTP 200 response, but the response body contains a JSON payload indicating an error: `{"error": "Could not understand the task"}`. This suggests that the agent's natural language processing component failed to interpret the user's instructions, even though the API endpoint was reachable and functioning correctly. Students facing this issue can infer that the problem lies with the way they are formulating the task for the LLM agent, not necessarily with the underlying API communication. They should focus on refining their prompts to be clearer, more specific, or adhere to any expected format outlined in the project documentation.se body that includes a JSON object. Within the JSON object, the "error" key has the value "Could not understand the task", indicating that the LLM agent was unable to interpret the user's input or command. This suggests the student is facing issues related to prompt engineering, task clarity, or the LLM's understanding capabilities. The student likely needs to rephrase their task or provide more context for the agent to process." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="7qlFPLx7jz367QF7junfCfApvNu" width="618" height="246">image618×246 6.28 KB
