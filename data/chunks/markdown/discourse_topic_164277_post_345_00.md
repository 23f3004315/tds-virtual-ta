## Post #345 by 23f2001975

very true there is too much confusion Id like to ask if you know that evaluate.py is mean to run only for user@example.com or our own mail too because there was written **You MUST use your Student Id** (eg. 22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) **to do the Project, otherwise your score will not be considered for evaluation.**
