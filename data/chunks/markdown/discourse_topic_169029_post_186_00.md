Subject: Request for Uniform Evaluation Process in Project 2 - TDS Solver.

Hello @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini sir.

We truly appreciate the effort you put into designing and evaluating our graded assignments and projects. We understand that any five random questions will be selected for evaluation, and we fully respect this approach.

However, we kindly request that the same set of five questions be used for all students to ensure a uniform and unbiased evaluation process. This way, the difficulty level remains consistent across all evaluations, providing a fair assessment of our understanding.

Thank you for considering our request. We appreciate your guidance and support.

Best regards,

Digvijaysinh Chudasama.
