**[Discussion Image by 22f3000370]** This image depicts the UI of the "AI Assignment Solver" application, likely used in the TDS project. It presents options for both uploading a file and asking a question. The "Upload a File" section has a "Choose File" button, which currently shows "No file chosen," and an "Upload" button; the interface also displays the message "No file uploaded". Below this is the "Ask a Question" section, which features a text input labeled "Enter your question here" and a "Submit" button, followed by a "Answer will appear here." placeholder. The overall design suggests an interactive system where users can either upload a file for processing or directly pose a question to receive an answer. This likely represents a student working on the UI and functionality related to file uploading and question submission.oose File" button (currently showing "No file chosen") followed by an "Upload" button, or entering a question in the "Enter your question here" text box followed by a "Submit" button. The image also shows the message "No file uploaded" which means a file was not uploaded yet. Below the "Submit" button is a text area labeled "Answer will appear here", presumably where the AI's response will be displayed. This suggests a student is either exploring or troubleshooting the assignment solver interface to understand how to interact with the tool and obtain answers." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="7sVtZMiBrg1rsQT7DRTZs5rYuYl" width="439" height="459">image439Ã—459 28.4 KB
