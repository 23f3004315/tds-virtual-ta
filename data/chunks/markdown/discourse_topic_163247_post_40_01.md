**[Discussion Image by 23f2002592]** This image depicts a student's code and the resulting error while using the OpenAI API, indicating a debugging scenario. The student's code constructs a message with the role "user" and content instructing the API to list valid English words from a given set of tokens. The code then uses the `requests.post` method to send a request to a URL, including headers and JSON data. The subsequent conditional statement checks if the response status code is 200, printing a formatted JSON response if successful; otherwise, it prints an error message with the status code and the raw response text for debugging. Crucially, the code produces a "Request failed with status code: 429", coupled with an error message from the API: "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details," indicating the student has reached their API usage limit. billing details," along with the error type and code both indicated as "insufficient_quota", including a link to OpenAI documentation. This indicates the student has used up their allocated API usage, likely requiring them to upgrade their subscription or wait for the usage to reset." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-29 094832" data-base62-sha1="xDKm5CY60C8vBvcICfa14JNRaJr" width="690" height="256" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2002592]** This image shows a student encountering an error while using the OpenAI API, specifically a 429 error ("Request failed with status code: 429"), indicating they've exceeded their current quota. The Python code makes a POST request to the OpenAI API using the `requests` library. The code checks the response status; if it's 200 (success), it prints the JSON response, otherwise, it prints an error message including the status code and the full error text for debugging. The error message received from the API is "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details," and includes a link to the OpenAI documentation for more information. This suggests the student needs to upgrade their OpenAI account or reduce API usage to resolve the issue., **[Discussion Image by 23f2002592]** This image depicts a student debugging code related to calling the OpenAI API in a discussion thread, showing a "Request failed with status code: 429" error. The student’s code includes a `requests.post` call to the OpenAI API, sending a JSON payload with a prompt asking for valid English words from a list of strings. An `if` statement checks the response status code, printing the JSON response if successful (status code 200), or printing an error message and the full response text otherwise. The error message received indicates "insufficient_quota", meaning the student has exceeded their current OpenAI API usage quota, as explained in the error's message and in the provided link to OpenAI documentation. The error suggests checking the user's plan and billing details on the OpenAI platform. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2002592]** This image captures a student's struggle with the OpenAI API, showing a code snippet and the resulting error message indicating they've exceeded their quota. The code includes a JSON payload setting the user role and requesting a list of valid English words from a provided list of mixed words and strings. Following this, the Python code makes a POST request using the `requests` library to a specified URL, passing headers and the JSON data, then it checks the response status code, printing the JSON response if successful (200), otherwise printing an error message and the raw response text. The received error, "Request failed with status code: 429", contains a JSON object explaining "insufficient_quota" and suggesting a review of the plan and billing details, including a link to the OpenAI documentation. This serves as a valuable learning example for new students on handling API quotas and debugging error responses from external services. 2x" data-dominant-color="2B2B2A">Screenshot 2025-01-29 0948321770×659 35.1 KB
