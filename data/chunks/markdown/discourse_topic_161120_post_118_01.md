**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image shows a student, Jivraj, encountering an error message on Vercel: "Team Access Required." The message indicates that the signed-in user, "jivraj-18", does not have the necessary permissions to access the unique deployment URL because they are not a member of the team associated with the project. It provides a workaround, suggesting the user request access to the "up-to-date deployment URL" to view the latest version. The screen also includes a link to "Log in with a different Vercel Account," implying a possible solution if the user has access via a different account. This is likely a student question about deployment permissions needing resolution by the instructor.o/access/request?next=%2Fsso-api%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-proj...".

The user, "jivraj-18", encounters a "Team Access Required" error when trying to access a deployment URL, indicating they are not a member of the team associated with the deployment. The displayed message informs the user "You cannot access this unique deployment URL as you are not a member of the team. You can view the latest version of this branch by requesting access to the up-to-date deployment URL". Two options are presented: request access to the up-to-date deployment URL or log in with a different Vercel account. This suggests a permissions issue related to team membership within the Vercel platform, where the student needs to be properly authorized to view the deployment., **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image shows a "Team Access Required" error in Vercel encountered by the student 'Jivraj'. The error message states, "You cannot access this unique deployment URL as you are not a member of the team." The student is advised to view the latest version by requesting access to the "up-to-date deployment URL" or to "Log in with a different Vercel Account". This suggests the student is trying to access a deployment URL that requires team membership, but their account isn't properly associated with the team in Vercel. This is likely a student question about access control within Vercel deployments. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image captures a student's problem during a deployment tools assignment, specifically within the Vercel platform. The screenshot displays a "Team Access Required" error page encountered by student Jivraj, who is signed in as "jivraj-18". The message indicates that the student is not a member of the team associated with the unique deployment URL they are trying to access and suggests either requesting access to the "up-to-date deployment URL" or logging in with a different Vercel account. The full URL visible in the browser address bar is "https://vercel.com/sso/access/request?next=%2Fsso-api%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-proj...". This suggests a potential issue with team permissions or account access within the Vercel environment, which requires instructor intervention to resolve the student's deployment obstacle. 2x" data-dominant-color="070607">image1822×874 43.7 KB
