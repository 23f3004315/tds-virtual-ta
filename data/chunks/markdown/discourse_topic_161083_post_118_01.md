**[Discussion Image by 21f3000745]** This image shows a student attempting assignment #10, "Multi-cursor edits to convert to JSON". The task involves downloading "q-multi-cursor-json.txt", using multi-cursors to convert the text into a single JSON object (where key-value pairs become `{key: value, key: value, ...}`), then pasting the resulting JSON into a tool at `tools-in-data-science.pages.dev/jsonhash` and clicking the "Hash" button. The student pasted a hash value of "c0b9426a7f358720f193d3806497ec0d81d10d835085d0f284f804bf3a6a1536", but the system indicates "Incorrect. Try again.", implying the conversion to JSON or the hashing process was flawed, thus initiating a troubleshooting process within the discussion thread. The student will likely seek clarification or help from peers or instructors to identify and correct the error in their JSON conversion or hashing step.835085d0f284f804bf3a6a1536), indicated by an error message, implying the student needs to re-examine their JSON conversion or hashing process. This illustrates a point of student confusion with a clear error state." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="wOVqqMx7HHItdOrqggliCuYjECW" width="690" height="133" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 21f3000745]** This image shows a student's attempt to answer question 10 from the "GA1 - Development Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]". The task requires downloading "q-multi-cursor-json.txt", using multi-cursors to convert its content into a single JSON object with the format `{key: value, key: value, ...}`, then pasting the resulting JSON into the `tools-in-data-science.pages.dev/jsonhash` tool and clicking the "Hash" button. The image displays the student's attempted hash value "c0b9426a7f358720f193d3806497ec0d81d10d835085d0f284f804bf3a6a1536", along with the error message "Incorrect. Try again," indicating an incorrect answer. The task involves using multi-cursors to transform the data, understanding JSON formatting, and using an external tool to generate a hash, which is then used to check the answer., **[Discussion Image by 21f3000745]** This image shows a student attempting a graded question (0.5 marks) related to development tools. The task requires the student to download "q-multi-cursor-json.txt", use multi-cursors in an editor to convert the contents into a single JSON object formatted as `{key: value, key: value, ...}`, paste the resulting JSON into the input field at `tools-in-data-science.pages.dev/jsonhash`, and click the "Hash" button. The student has entered "c0b9426a7f358720f193d3806497ec0d81d10d835085d0f284f804bf3a6a1536" as their answer, but it is marked as "Incorrect. Try again." This indicates that the student needs to re-examine their JSON conversion using multi-cursors and ensure it adheres to the specified format before hashing it on the provided web tool. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 21f3000745]** This image depicts a student attempt to complete a graded exercise regarding multi-cursor editing to convert text into JSON. The exercise directs the student to download a 'q-multi-cursor-json.txt' file, use multi-cursor editing to transform key-value pairs into a JSON object with the format `{key: value, key: value, ...}`, paste the resulting JSON into 'tools-in-data-science.pages.dev/jsonhash', and submit the generated hash. The student has entered a hash 'c0b9426a7f358720f193d3806497ec0d81d10d835085d0f284f804bf3a6a1536', but the system indicates that it's "Incorrect. Try again," implying the student needs to revise their conversion or hashing process. The red error box shows there is an issue with their answer. 2x" data-dominant-color="F7F6F8">image1635Ã—317 28 KB
