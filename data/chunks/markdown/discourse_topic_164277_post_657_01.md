**[Discussion Image by thinkmachine]** This image shows a student's initial submission results for Project 1, which is an LLM-based Automation Agent assignment. The output indicates that the Docker image failed the "present in Dockerhub AND is public" check, which is highlighted with a red circle and results in an overall "Prerequisites: FAIL" status and a score of 0. The GitHub repository being present and public, the Dockerfile being in the root of the repository, and the MIT license also being in the root of the repository all passed. The student seems surprised, indicated by the "???" next to the "Dockerfile present..." line, likely expecting the Dockerfile check to fail as well if the image itself couldn't be found or wasn't public. This suggests the student is grappling with Docker image publication requirements.ates that the Docker image is not found on Docker Hub or is not public, resulting in a "FAIL" status, thus the overall prequisites are failed and project score is zero. The GitHub repository is found and public ("PASS"), the Dockerfile is present in the root of the GitHub repository ("PASS"), and the MIT license is also present ("PASS"). The student seems to be questioning the "Dockerfile present" result as noted by the question marks on the side, possibly indicating some confusion around the "FAIL" for docker image but "PASS" for dockerfile. Addressing the Docker image issue (ensuring it's both present and public on Docker Hub) is crucial to passing the prerequisites and receiving a non-zero project score." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="3HoFXyYqbYD2IGHEd2R2HnPbOkR" width="412" height="167">image412Ã—167 4.49 KB
