**[Discussion Image by 23f1000598]** This image shows a student's prerequisite evaluation results for Project 1. The Docker image check passes, but the Github repository, the Dockerfile, and the MIT license checks all fail, indicating that the project does not meet the minimum requirements for evaluation. Specifically, it indicates that the Github repository is either not present, not public, or inaccessible to the grader, and that the Dockerfile and MIT license are not located in the root of the designated Github repository. This likely indicates a problem with repository configuration, file placement, or permissions on Github. The overall project score is therefore 0.T license in the root directory." alt="Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 3.19.32 PM" data-base62-sha1="wCyRjbKJqbqbnnXopUNDisHFFma" width="690" height="172" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1000598]** This image displays the prerequisite evaluations for Project 1, revealing that while the Docker image is successfully present and public, the Github repo, Dockerfile, and MIT license are all failing checks within the root of the Github repository. The report indicates "FAIL" for the overall prerequisites, leading to a Project 1 score of 0, suggesting the student has not met the minimum requirements for evaluation. The student likely needs to ensure their Github repository is public and includes the Dockerfile and MIT license file in the root directory. This is an instructor's/autograder output, not a student's code or error message. The red underlining highlights these errors., **[Discussion Image by 23f1000598]** This image shows a student's Project 1 prerequisite evaluation, indicating a problem with their submission. The evaluation reveals that the Docker image is present and public in Docker Hub, but the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license are failing to be detected in the root of the GitHub repository. This results in the student failing the prerequisites and receiving a project score of 0, implying they will not be evaluated. The student likely needs to ensure their GitHub repository is public and contains a Dockerfile and MIT license at the root level for the evaluation to pass. The underlined "FAIL" results highlight the specific issues needing attention. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1000598]** This image shows a student's Project 1 prerequisite evaluation, indicating the results of automated checks. The Docker image in Docker Hub is public and passes, but the Github repo being public and having a Dockerfile and MIT license in the root of the repo all failed. As a result of the failed prerequisites, the overall project score is 0. This evaluation is likely part of a peer discussion where students are comparing their results and troubleshooting issues, trying to understand why their Github repository is not recognized as public, or why the Dockerfile and MIT license are not found. The "FAIL" states suggest the student needs to ensure the Github repository is publicly accessible and that both the "Dockerfile" and "MIT license" files are located in the root directory of the repository. 2x" data-dominant-color="F7F7F7">Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 3.19.32 PM1894×474 49.3 KB
