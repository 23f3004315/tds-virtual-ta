**[Discussion Image by 21f3002112]** This image shows an email containing feedback on a student's TDS project submission. The email outlines the scoring system, where each completed task (A1-A10, B1-B10, C1-C5, with C1-C5 as bonus) earns 1 mark, and the total score is out of 20 with normalization based on the highest score in Project 1 (16). The bonus is awarded for the number of commits and repo size, with a power transform and scaling applied. The final score calculation uses MIN(20, (task score + bonus)). The email also provides the submitted GitHub and Docker repo links along with pre-requisite checks including timestamp and license file existence. A table displays the score received for each task A1 to A10, and B1 to B10, which are all currently marked as 0., along with prerequisite checks indicating whether the repos exist and are public, and if license and Dockerfile are present.
