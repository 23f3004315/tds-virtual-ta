[**[Course Image: LLM Sentiment Analysis]** This image illustrates how textual data is presented when performing sentiment analysis using LLMs (Large Language Models). The text shown comes from what appears to be a TV show script about a prison called "OZ" or "Security State Penitentiary". The educational objective of this image is to illustrate the type of textual data on which sentiment analysis is performed. The broader curriculum on LLM sentiment analysis involves understanding how to process raw text and determine its emotional tone using machine learning models. In TDS projects, this could involve choosing appropriate data, preparing it, and using LLMs to extract insights on emotions or opinions, and understanding how textual data is used as an input for sentiment analysis.nalysis," the image presents a block of text likely used as input for sentiment analysis. The text describes a place called "OZ," referring to a Security State Penitentiary and focusing on its experimental section with various groups of people and shady agreements. To perform sentiment analysis, this text would be fed into a language model (LLM) to determine the overall sentiment expressed (e.g., negative, neutral, or positive) based on the content's description of prison life and potential conflicts. The goal is to teach students how LLMs can interpret the emotional tone of written material. Students will learn that understanding context is key in analyzing sentiment and recognize that certain words or phrases can heavily influence the outcome.)](https://youtu.be/_D46QrX-2iU)

This video explains how to use large language models (LLMs) for sentiment analysis and classification, covering:

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Use OpenAI API to identify the sentiment of movie reviews as positive or negative.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Learn how to craft effective prompts to get desired results from LLMs.
- **LLM Training**: Understand how to train LLMs by providing examples and feedback.
- **OpenAI API Integration**: Integrate OpenAI API into Python code to perform sentiment analysis.
- **Tokenization**: Learn about tokenization and its impact on LLM input and cost.
- **Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Multi-Shot Learning**: Understand different approaches to using LLMs for learning.
