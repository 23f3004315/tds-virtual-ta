## Post #303 by Arunvembu

Hi sir

I noticed a discrepancy in my Project 1 results. In the initial results shared on March 29th, I had received 8/20 based on the evaluation logs. However, the final result I received today states that none of the tasks in Task A and B were working, and I was awarded only 1 bonus mark.

During my own testing, I was consistently getting 7/10 correct in Task A, so Iâ€™m a bit confused about the change.

Kindly request you to look into this discrepancy sir

Thank you
