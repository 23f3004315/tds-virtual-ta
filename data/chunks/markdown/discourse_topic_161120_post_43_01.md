**[Discussion Image by 23f2003751]** This post shows a student question regarding Vercel deployment in the context of a TDS discussion. The student is attempting to deploy a Python app to Vercel that exposes an API endpoint. The task involves downloading a "q-vercel-python.json" file containing student marks and creating an API that returns JSON responses of student marks based on the names provided in the query parameters. The student asks what the Vercel URL should look like and then provides their attempt: "https://student-marks-gb9zwxnfx-tushars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/api", which results in a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error, indicating a problem with accessing the deployed API endpoint.rror. This suggests an issue with the API endpoint or the server's ability to handle the request." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="k42xZ62KOgtry6KaD1l0ETh2lnf" width="690" height="175" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2003751]** This image shows a student's question regarding a Vercel deployment assignment in the TDS Jan 2025 cohort. The task involves creating a Python app deployed to Vercel that exposes an API. The desired API endpoint is `https://your-app.vercel.app/api` which, upon receiving a request like `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y`, should return a JSON response containing the marks for names X and Y. The student is asking "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`", and is reporting an error "TypeError: Failed to fetch" for the URL `https://student-marks-gb9zwxnfx-tushars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/api`., **[Discussion Image by 23f2003751]** This image shows a student troubleshooting a Vercel deployment for a Python API. The assignment requires the student to download a `q-vercel-python.json` file, create a Python app and deploy it to Vercel, exposing an API endpoint that returns JSON responses containing the marks of students whose names are passed as query parameters (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y`). The student has provided their Vercel URL: `https://student-marks-gb9zwxnfx-tushars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/api` and is encountering a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error, highlighted with a red border. This indicates a problem with the API endpoint or the deployment itself, likely preventing the server from responding to the request. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2003751]** This image captures a student's question within the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion, where they are struggling with a Vercel deployment. The assignment requires creating a Python app and deploying it to Vercel to expose an API that returns student marks as a JSON response. The student attempted to access their Vercel URL (https://student-marks-gb9zwxnfx-tushars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/api) but encountered a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error, indicating an issue preventing the client-side script from accessing the API endpoint. The problem could involve network connectivity, an error on the server-side API, or an incorrect URL. The student's question indicates confusion about what the correct Vercel URL should look like. 2x" data-dominant-color="24272B">image1636Ã—415 30 KB
