**[Discussion Image by 24f1002359]** This image depicts a student's terminal output in VS Code while running a FastAPI application using Uvicorn. The terminal shows that the server started successfully, listening on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The student is encountering "404 Not Found" errors when trying to access the root path ("/") and "/favicon.ico", suggesting the application is not configured to handle these routes, but requests to `/api?class=1A` are successful, returning a "200 OK" status. This indicates a partial success in setting up the application, but also a need to define handlers for the root and favicon routes if they are intended to be accessible. The directory `F:\\BS DATA SCIENCE\\Diploma Level\\TERM 2\\TDS\\Week 2\\Fastapi` is being watched for changes.e 404 errors. The successful API calls confirm that the core application setup is correct, and the student needs to address the missing route issue." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-02 194829" data-base62-sha1="pr0GdazApRmdCsapfHhOyajUlbg" width="690" height="215" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 24f1002359]** This image shows the terminal output of a FastAPI application running in a student's project directory, indicating a peer discussion or instructor answer related to deployment tools. The Uvicorn server is running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, and the application has started successfully. The student likely navigated to the base URL `/` and `/favicon.ico`, resulting in "404 Not Found" errors, while the `/api` and `/api?class=1A` endpoints return a "200 OK" status, implying successful access to those routes. This suggests a possible issue with the application's routing or file serving configuration for the root path and favicon, while the defined API endpoints are functioning as expected. Examining the main.py or other router files would likely clarify why the root route is not found., **[Discussion Image by 24f1002359]** This image shows the terminal output within a student's VS Code environment during a TDS (Technical Data Science) assignment, specifically related to FastAPI deployment. The output logs the startup sequence of Uvicorn, indicating it's running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. There are successful "200 OK" GET requests to the `/api` endpoint, sometimes with query parameters such as `?class=1A`. However, there are also "404 Not Found" errors for the root route ("/") and `/favicon.ico`, suggesting the student may not have defined a route for the root path or configured the favicon properly in their FastAPI application. This indicates a potential confusion point for the student regarding route definitions and static file serving in FastAPI. The presence of "StatReload" suggests auto-reloading is enabled, which is useful for development. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 24f1002359]** This image depicts the terminal output in VS Code from a student's Fast API deployment, indicating a mix of successful and unsuccessful HTTP requests, suggesting a peer discussion around debugging API endpoints. The terminal output shows Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 and watching for changes in the specified directory. It logs that the application startup is complete, but then shows "404 Not Found" errors for "GET / HTTP/1.1" and "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" while successfully returning "200 OK" for "GET /api HTTP/1.1" and "GET /api?class=1A HTTP/1.1", implying that the default route ("/") and favicon are not properly configured in the FastAPI application, but the explicitly defined `/api` routes are working as expected. The student might be confused about how to configure the root route in FastAPI or how to serve static files like favicons, as it could be a missing route definition or incorrect static file configuration. The resolution might involve adding a route for "/" or configuring static files serving for the favicon. 2x" data-dominant-color="0A1F2E">Screenshot 2025-02-02 1948291626×509 48.5 KB
