**[Discussion Image by 23f2003717]** This image is from a student discussion thread about data preparation. The image shows a snippet of a table with three columns: "city," "product," and "sales." The "city" column is populated with "London", and the "product" column is populated with "Computer." The "sales" column contains numerical values, suggesting that the student might be working with sales data and encountering issues related to data consistency, aggregation, or cleaning, perhaps as part of the "GA5 - Data Preparation" assignment referenced in the thread title. The dropdown arrows in the column headers suggest the student is able to sort or filter the data, possibly as part of troubleshooting their data preparation steps.Specifically, it shows repeated entries of "London" in the city column, "Computer" in the product column, and corresponding sales figures in the "sales" column. The image likely reflects a student working through data cleaning or transformation steps within the assignment, where they may need to address repetitive data or explore relationships between city, product, and sales. The dropdown arrows next to the column names suggests possible sorting or filtering options that are available within the UI." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="gHCtpYw1cDhjRv3XqZZUpNul3p3" width="441" height="323">image441Ã—323 4.22 KB
