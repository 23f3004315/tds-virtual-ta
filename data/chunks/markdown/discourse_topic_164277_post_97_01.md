**[Discussion Image by 23f1000299]** This image is part of a TDS student discussion thread for Project 1, focusing on an LLM-based automation agent. The image outlines two tasks related to data extraction: first, extracting the sender's email address and saving it to `/data/email-sender.txt`, and second, extracting a credit card number from the `/data/credit-card.png` image using an LLM, and then writing the extracted number without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt`. This task is labeled as A8. This content appears to be an instructor post, guiding students on specific project requirements.ails." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="nt1RANtC1bK5k7LPCda2eu3wnHW" width="690" height="63" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1000299]** This image shows part of a project description for TDS students related to building an LLM-based automation agent.
