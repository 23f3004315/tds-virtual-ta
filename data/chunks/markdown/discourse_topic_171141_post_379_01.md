**[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image shows a student's evaluation log from a TDS project, highlighting errors encountered during execution. The log indicates that tasks related to reading `/data/b9.html` and `/data/b10.csv` failed, resulting in "Cannot read" errors and a score of 7/20. The error message "HTTPConnectionPool... Connection refused" suggests that the datasette server, expected to be running on localhost:8001, was not accessible, preventing the task from querying the ticket-sales.csv and saving the count of "Bronze" type rows to `/data/b10.csv`. The initial HTTP request indicates an attempt to start the datasette server using 'uvx datasette' to query and save data. The overall problem is the inability to establish a connection with the datasette server. error indicates that /data/b10.csv could not be found after the failed datasette query. The final score is 7/20, pointing to significant issues in the project's execution." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="3fYWhioqF0dVCW0CqLGyjCLCVMa" width="690" height="380" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image captures the log output from a student project evaluation, indicating a peer discussion related to project errors. The log shows several errors, including "B9 failed: Cannot read /data/b9.html" and "B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv", suggesting file access problems. A running task attempts to use 'uvx datasette' to count "Bronze" type rows in 'tickets' from 'ticket-sales.db' on port 8001, saving the result to /data/b10.csv, but fails with an HTTP 400 Bad Request error, specifically a "Connection refused" error when trying to establish a new connection to localhost:8001. This suggests the datasette server might not be running or accessible at the specified port, causing the evaluation to fail, resulting in a score of 7/20. The student needs to ensure the datasette server is correctly started and accessible., **[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image depicts a student's attempt to run a data analysis task using a local datasette instance and encountering multiple errors. The log shows that the task involves counting the number of rows where 'type' is "Bronze" in a 'tickets' dataset, saving the result to `/data/b10.csv`, and then stopping the datasette server. The errors include "B9 failed: Cannot read /data/b9.html," a "HTTP 400 Bad Request," and "HTTPConnectionPool...Connection refused," indicating a failure to connect to the datasette server on localhost:8001. Additionally, the log reports "B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv," which suggests the previous step of saving the data failed or the file was not created correctly. The student's score is 7/20 at this stage, highlighting the need for debugging the connection and data processing steps. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image captures a log output from a TDS project evaluation, indicating a student's code execution errors. The log shows a series of HTTP requests and responses, including failures to read files `/data/b9.html` and `/data/b10.csv` with "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found" errors, suggesting these files were not created or are not located in the expected directory. The task involves running a datasette to count rows where 'type' is "Bronze" from a 'tickets' table, saving the result to `/data/b10.csv`, but the attempt results in an HTTP 400 error and a connection refused error to localhost:8001, implying the datasette server either failed to start or is inaccessible. Ultimately, the student's score is 7/20, reflecting these errors and highlighting the need to troubleshoot the datasette setup and file handling. 2x" data-dominant-color="BBBBBB">image1850×1021 132 KB
