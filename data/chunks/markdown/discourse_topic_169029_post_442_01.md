**[Discussion Image by 23f1000598]** This image captures a student's troubleshooting process within the Vercel platform for the TDS Solver project, specifically related to a failed workflow trigger. The Vercel logs show that the email ID was successfully used and updated in `index.html`, but the process then failed with a 401 error ("Bad credentials") when trying to trigger a workflow. A "Gateway Timeout 504" error is also indicated under "Function Invocation" for route "/main.py", which is located in Washington, D.C., uses Python 3.12 runtime, and is configured with 10s execution limit and 1024 MB memory. The student likely encountered authentication problems preventing the workflow from executing successfully, and also ran into a timeout issue during function execution.nt's GitHub credentials may be incorrect or lack necessary permissions for the workflow, and the function might be timing out while trying to access external resources or services due to authorization issues." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="9zvSANeg0v939oraFznOdCsweJ2" width="690" height="291" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1000598]** This image shows the Vercel deployment logs and function invocation details for a TDS solver project. It indicates a "Gateway Timeout 504" error during function invocation of `/main.py`, alongside "Failed to trigger workflow: 401" with a "Bad credentials" message from the Github REST API. The log also displays successful email updates to "index.html" and email ID used. The function is running on Python 3.12 with a maximum execution duration of 10s and memory usage of 214MB out of 1024MB and the environment is set to production. These logs suggest authentication issues with GitHub actions are causing the workflow failure and ultimately leading to a timeout., **[Discussion Image by 23f1000598]** This image shows the logs and details of a Vercel function invocation, indicating a student is likely debugging their TDS project. The logs show that an email ID was processed, the index.html file was updated, but the workflow failed to trigger with a "401 Bad credentials" error, which suggests an issue with authentication when trying to interact with an external service, potentially GitHub as hinted by the documentation URL. The "Gateway Timeout 504" error further indicates the function call to '/api/main.py' timed out after 10 seconds, even though the function used only 214MB out of the 1024MB memory limit. These errors are displayed within the Vercel dashboard, showing information about the runtime environment (Python 3.12) and deployment details (deployment ID, production environment), suggesting the student is attempting to deploy or test their application on Vercel. The student needs to address both the GitHub authentication and the timeout issues in their '/api/main.py' function for successful execution. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1000598]** This image depicts a debugging scenario within the Vercel platform, likely during development of the TDS Solver project. The logs show a "Failed to trigger workflow" error, specifically a 401 error indicating "Bad credentials," and provide a link to the Github REST API documentation. It also displays a "Gateway Timeout 504" related to a Function Invocation for the `/api` route, pinpointing the `/main.py` file as the point of execution, and showing that the function executed for 10 seconds, consuming 214MB of memory. The deployment environment is noted as "production", and student email ID `23f1000598@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` is also included in the function logs. These errors point towards potential issues with authentication or external API calls during the workflow execution, suggesting a student is working on the authorization flow and debugging the associated errors within the project. 2x" data-dominant-color="F9F8F8">image2342Ã—990 233 KB
