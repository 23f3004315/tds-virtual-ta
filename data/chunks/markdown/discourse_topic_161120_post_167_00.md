The problem is that, if class param is passed, only then it is filtering as usual, but when no param is passed it returns the entire DataFrame, which is not supposed to happen.

If no parameter is passed it should return an empty list.

I suspect you directly copied this code from ChatGPT without understanding, which is acceptable for us, but not very helpful for you.
