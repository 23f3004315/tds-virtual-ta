## Post #24 by 21f3000697

**Direct Link**: [Post #24](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/166189/24)

I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final score is showing as **4.25**, but while attempting the assignment earlier, I had scored **7.25** shown after submission.

Could you please help me understand how the marks were reduced? I want to ensure there was no error or misunderstanding in the evaluation.
