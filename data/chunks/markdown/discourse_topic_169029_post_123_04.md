**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image depicts a console output showing the execution of the `tds/test.py` file within a virtual environment named `venvcarland`. The user `carland` is working on a MacBook Pro, indicated by the prompt `venvcarland@Carlton-MacBook-Pro tds %`. After running the Python script, the console prints a JSON-formatted string: `{"mary": "poppins", "age": 42}`. This output suggests that the script likely serializes a Python dictionary containing name and age data into JSON and prints it to the console. The successful execution without error messages indicates that the code is running as expected, serving as a possible test case or demonstration.nary: `{"mary": "poppins", "age": 42}`. This JSON data suggests the script is likely processing or generating data related to a person named Mary Poppins with an age of 42. The presence of the virtual environment ".venv" indicates the user is following best practices for project dependency management. The output confirms the successful execution of the test script and the structure of the data being handled." alt="Screenshot 2025-03-27 at 3.30.17 pm" data-base62-sha1="vU1GFSDk4aLLFTjZzOv1PffvXl6" width="287" height="59">
