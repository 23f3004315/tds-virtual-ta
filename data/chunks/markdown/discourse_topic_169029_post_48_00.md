My Approach , is to

scrape and parse all the current question
create embeddings , of the questions.
create a test endpoint , just to check if i am able to correctly identify the questions
segregate numerical , string and json responses and see if these can be answered part of phase 1
Phase 2 , experiment with url based answers. need to see if an MCP server can come in handy

to deploy a server and return an url
