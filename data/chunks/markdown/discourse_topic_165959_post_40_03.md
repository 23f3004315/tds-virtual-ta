**[Discussion Image by 23f2003853]** This image captures a student's question regarding a GitHub repository URL input error within the TDS Jan 2025 GA4 Data Sourcing discussion. The student, 23f2003853, has entered "https://github.com/23f2003853/workflows" into the repository URL field. An error message is displayed: "Error: No executed job step matches 23f2003853@dsstudy.iitm.ac.in", indicating a mismatch between the repository name derived from the URL and the expected student identifier. This suggests the system is expecting a repository associated with the student's designated email. The instructions above the URL field show to trigger the workflow and ensure it creates a commit within five minutes, suggesting the validation is checking for recent activity tied to the expected repository. The student needs to correct the URL to point to their actual GitHub repository or adjust their GitHub configuration to match the expected user identifier to resolve this "no executed job step matches" error.s attempting to input the repository URL in the specified format of `https://github.com/USER/REPO`, having created a workflow located in the `.github/workflows/` directory. The entered URL is `https://github.com/23f2003853/workflows`, but the system returns the error message: "Error: No executed job step matches 23f2003853@dsstudy.iitm.ac.in". This error suggests the workflow execution is not linked to the expected user or email, potentially indicating a mismatch between the repository owner or a misconfiguration in the workflow's authentication or deployment settings, and is likely a student question rather than instructor explanation. The student has clicked the "Check" button, triggering the validation which resulted in the reported error." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="v6lOaEztcBjqRxxgVA9lUxkszSN" width="602" height="164">image602Ã—164 21 KB
