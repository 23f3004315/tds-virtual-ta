**[Discussion Image by Jayeshbansal]** This image depicts a student's difficulty related to API endpoint configuration within the TDS GA3 Large Language Models course. The instructor prompts for the API URL endpoint, providing an example of `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`. The student inputs `http://127.0.0.1:9000/execute`, but the application responds with a `SyntaxError: "[object Object]" is not valid JSON` error. This indicates that the API is not receiving or parsing the input data in the expected JSON format, and the "object Object" suggests that the API is receiving an unformatted javascript object instead of the correct JSON string.error when the system attempts to interpret it. The student likely needs to revise the way they are sending or receiving data to ensure it complies with JSON syntax requirements, often involving correct structure with key-value pairs and proper data types. The error suggests the data being returned is a generic Javascript object instead of valid JSON." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="eLXGuHi63PdnJqvbCVcs7QPqJIs" width="690" height="58" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Jayeshbansal]** This image captures a student's attempt to use the API endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:9000/execute` in the TDS Jan 2025 course, as part of a discussion thread about large language models. The student is prompted to provide the API URL endpoint for their implementation, and the instructor gives an example URL of `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute.` When the student tries using the given API endpoint, the system returns the error message "SyntaxError: '[object Object]' is not valid JSON," indicating that the API is not receiving or processing the input data in the expected JSON format, which represents a common issue of data serialization or format mismatch when interfacing with APIs. This indicates the API endpoint is not correctly handling the student's request, likely due to an issue with how the data is being sent or the API's expectation of the input. The error suggests that the student needs to examine the format of the data being sent to the API to ensure it's properly formatted as JSON., **[Discussion Image by Jayeshbansal]** This image captures a student's attempt to specify the API URL endpoint in the TDS LLM discussion forum, resulting in a "SyntaxError: '[object Object]' is not valid JSON" error. The student inputs `http://127.0.0.1:9000/execute` into what appears to be a text field intended for a URL, as requested by the instructor's example `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`. The error message indicates that the system expects a valid JSON object, but receives something else, highlighting a potential misunderstanding about the format required for the API endpoint, and that an error message is triggered. This could be related to data type mismatch, incorrect data formatting, or issues in how the data is being serialized or interpreted by the LLM system when processing the provided URL. The red border around the input field, along with the error and the exclamation mark icon, indicates that the entered input is not being correctly processed. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Jayeshbansal]** This image captures a student question within a TDS Large Language Models discussion thread, specifically post #120 by Jayeshbansal, where the instructor is asking the student to provide their API URL endpoint, suggesting it might resemble "http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute". The image then shows the student's provided URL, "http://127.0.0.1:9000/execute", along with an error message: "SyntaxError: '[object Object]' is not valid JSON". This indicates that the student's endpoint is likely returning a JavaScript object, not a valid JSON response, which is causing the error. The student needs to ensure the API endpoint returns data formatted as valid JSON to resolve the issue. 2x" data-dominant-color="FBF7F7">image1572Ã—133 10.7 KB
