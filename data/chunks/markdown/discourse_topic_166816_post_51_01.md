The discussion centers around discrepancies, where students find the scores displayed here don't match their actual grades, thus showing the confusion students have with the graded assignments dashboard. The table shown has one students id and 2 different grades given on different dates.

The table displays the email "22f3000935@ds.study.iitm.ac.in", the submission date/time, the score received (e.g., 7.75 or 7), and the total possible score (10). There are duplicate entries with the same assignment name and email but different dates and scores, suggesting possible regrades or multiple attempts. The core issue is that the student observes inconsistencies or incorrect scores displayed within the assignment dashboard. This screenshot is used in the context of a TDS course where a student named Carlton reported discrepancies between the dashboard scores and the actual grades received. 2x" data-dominant-color="EFEFEF">Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 10.57.15 am2624Ã—358 28.8 KB
