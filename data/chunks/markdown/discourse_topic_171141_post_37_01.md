’t read the file.”

I understand that this oversight was my mistake. However, is there any way to reevaluate the code by simply uncommenting that line? I believe the rest of the code is properly written, but due to this single comment, all the files remained unchecked or resulted in errors.

**[Discussion Image by Pritul_raut]** This image shows a student's evaluation log during a project in the "Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies" discussion. The log displays error messages related to accessing files and executing tasks, indicating issues with file paths and server requests. Specifically, "HTTP 500" errors with "No such file or directory" are shown for `/app./data/mail.txt` and `/data/card.jpg`, plus "HTTP 404 Not Found" errors for `/data/mail-sender.txt` and `/data/cc-number.txt`, and "Internal Server Error" occurs when processing `/data/card.jpg`. Additionally, the log contains task descriptions such as "extract the card number" from `/data/card.jpg` and "find the most similar pair of comments" from `/data/comments.txt`, revealing the project's requirements. It indicates the student is facing issues with the program correctly locating and processing necessary files, which leads to failed tasks.out error." alt="Screenshot (177)" data-base62-sha1="oJVfpgHJTo53TpCxytaHv96KM6O" width="690" height="388" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Pritul_raut]** This image shows a student's evaluation log from a TDS project, revealing multiple errors and failures in the automated assessment process. The log displays HTTP 500 errors indicating "No such file or directory" for '/app./data/mail.txt' and '/data/card.jpg', alongside HTTP 404 errors when attempting to GET '/data/mail-sender.txt' and '/data/cc-number.txt'. The log also details failed tasks like reading specific files, extracting card numbers from an image, and finding similar comments using embeddings, indicated by "A7 failed" and "A8 failed" messages. The student is likely facing issues with file paths or missing files within the project's directory structure, causing the automated evaluation to fail. Successful POST requests to the OpenAI embeddings endpoint are also visible, showing that some parts of the evaluation are working correctly., **[Discussion Image by Pritul_raut]** This image shows a log file from a student's project submission, revealing multiple errors encountered during automated evaluation. The student is encountering "No such file or directory" errors (Errno 2) for `/app./data/mail.txt` and `./data/card.jpg`, suggesting issues with file paths or missing files. Furthermore, there are HTTP 404 Not Found errors when trying to read `/data/mail-sender.txt` and `/data/cc-number.txt`, indicated by messages such as "A7 failed: Cannot read /data/mail-sender.txt". An HTTP 500 Internal Server Error also appears when processing the card image extraction task, specifically due to problems in the provided image path. Lastly, a successful HTTP 200 OK status is shown when calling the OpenAI embeddings API via the proxy, indicating that at least this one component of the project is working correctly. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Pritul_raut]** This image captures a student's debugging log, likely shared in a discussion about the TDS project. The log details a series of HTTP requests and errors encountered while running different tasks. The errors suggest file not found issues, such as "No such file or directory: '/app./data/mail.txt'" and "No such file or directory: './data/card.jpg'", alongside "HTTP 404 Not Found" errors when trying to read those files. Another error encountered is "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error", during a POST request that aims to extract card number from an image using an LLM. The student is facing issues with file paths and potentially LLM task execution, indicating a need for assistance in troubleshooting directory structure and API endpoint usage. 2x" data-dominant-color="BBBBBB">Screenshot (177)1920×1080 206 KB
