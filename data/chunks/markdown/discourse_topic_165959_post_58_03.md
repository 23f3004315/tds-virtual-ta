However, an error message is displayed: "Error: No executed job step matches 21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in", indicating that the system is unable to find a matching job step associated with the student's email. The instructions above the input field specify that the workflow needs to be triggered, must be the most recent action, and should have a commit within 5 minutes of the workflow run, suggesting a potential issue with the workflow setup or recent commit history within the repository. The student seems to be struggling with configuring the GitHub workflow correctly so that the system recognizes the associated job step during verification.uted correctly within the workflow. It is likely a student question showing their attempt and asking for help with resolving the error." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="dl6Ql62KJpEVKRKNqm1UrBjTEeG" width="690" height="137" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 21f2000588]** This image captures a student, identified as 21f2000588, encountering an error when submitting their Github repository URL for the "GA4 - Data Sourcing" assignment.

The student entered `https://github.com/DigvijaysinhChudasamalITM/TDS_GA_4` into the repository URL field, following the format `https://github.com/USER/REPO`.

The student, identified as 21f2000588, has entered their repository URL `https://github.com/DigvijaysinhChudasamalITM/TDS_GA_4` but is encountering an error: "Error: No executed job step matches 21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". This indicates that the workflow, despite being created, isn't executing correctly, specifically the job steps aren't being associated with the student's ID. The interface also reminds the student to trigger the workflow, ensure it's the most recent action in the repository, and that it creates a commit within 5 minutes. The error message suggests a mismatch or misconfiguration in how the workflow execution is linked back to the student. 2x" data-dominant-color="282B2F">image1605×320 26.5 KB
