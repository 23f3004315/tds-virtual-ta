 the CDN service giving some sort of response. We'll have to check with Anand.

**Q16: Is my screen visible? In this Vercel question, what happened is that sometimes it was showing correctly earlier, and now it's showing an error. And look, it's showing correctly again. I don't know why this happens. The score also...**

**A16:** At the moment, it's working, right? There was a slight bug; we discussed it this morning with Anand. There was a slight bug in the random generator for the file that you use. I believe it's been fixed now. That's why you're not getting an error at the moment. If you come across this problem again, notify us on Discourse.

**Q17: I'm getting an error from this. I don't know how...**

**A17:** In the ninth question, you're getting an error. Earlier, it was working fine. You'll need to... this is the Vercel one, right? No, this is the FastAPI one. You'll have to run the server for that. You should post this on Discourse. Just copy that whole error message itself and put it in a notepad or something, and then post on Discourse.

**Q18: One more thing I wanted to say: actually, I'm not... while installing ngrok with this terminal, I wasn't able to do that, so I installed it in a different directory using the app. Is it doing anything? When I run it from here...**

**A18:** It shouldn't matter because we are able to access it through the browser. It was still able to access it, and you can see a 200 OK on there. That means the site is running okay; your model is running okay. Why you're getting a Cloudflare error, I'm not entirely sure. That's normally to do with the CDN service that is giving some sort of response out there. We'll have to check with Anand what the issue is.

**Q19: Is my screen visible? In this Vercel question, what happened is that sometimes it was showing correctly, and now it's showing an error. And look, it's showing correctly again. I don't know why this happens. The score also...**

**A19:** It looks like a Cloudflare error. I've noted this error. It is from Cloudflare. You could just try again. When did you try this, apart from just now? You got the same error yesterday as well? Yeah, so that's some logic error in your code. It should not fetch all of it. There is some logic error.

**Q20: Should I install it separately?**
