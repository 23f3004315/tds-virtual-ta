@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

I would like to share that we have successfully completed **TDS Project 2**, solving **46/57** cases dynamically via **Azure after deployment**! We also tested it with our friends’ **GA questions**, and it’s working as expected.

This project was a **team effort** by me and two friends [ @lakshaygarg654 and @23f2004637 ], and we are thrilled with the results post-deployment.

I would love the opportunity to **demonstrate our project** to **TA and Anand Sir** in a **Google Meet session** on **March 31st** (since I have OPPE on the 29th and 30th).

If you can spare some time for a quick look at our project, it would be awesome! Looking forward to your response.
