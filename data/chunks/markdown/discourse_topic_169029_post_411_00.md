Hello @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj Could you please share an update on the expected results for P2? Also, could you confirm whether my evaluation has been completed?

Additionally, when would it be safe to stop the VM, as it is consuming a significant amount of credits?

Looking forward to your response.

Thanks and Regards.
