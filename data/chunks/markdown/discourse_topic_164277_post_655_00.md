## Post #655 by 21f3001993

**Direct Link**: [Post #655](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/164277/655)

I would like to request some bonus like 0.5 bonus mark for each day of delay from the original expected date of receiving score for Project 1 (will be life-saving for us and will be an incentive for team to release scores quickly; or request to TAs if you had better ideas for helping us score more in Project 1)!
