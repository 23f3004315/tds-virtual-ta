Post #129](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/163247/129)

I have counted the number of tokens in gpt-4o-mini but when I was entering the answer in portal it was showing incorrect please take a look and provide a solution for it .

**[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image shows the OpenAI Platform interface, specifically the "playground" area likely used for testing and experimenting with language models. The user has entered the prompt "List only the valid English words from these: [imagine a comma-separated list of mostly nonsensical strings]", and the interface displays the input token and character counts as 406 and 625, respectively. The specific LLM being tested is selected from the tab "GPT-3.5 & GPT-4" (although, based on the presence of the "GPT-4o" option, this might actually represent the GPT-4 model). The red squiggly lines under each word indicates that the OpenAI Platform identifies most of the strings as invalid or misspelled words, aligning with the user's intention to test the model's ability to filter actual English words from a collection of meaningless strings. The image provides a clear context of user interaction with the OpenAI platform for model testing and prompt engineering.1 180627" data-base62-sha1="o524PiqcD03bScfEheFjdh8Soii" width="690" height="332" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image depicts a student using the OpenAI Platform's playground interface, accessible via a web browser, likely for testing or experimenting with a prompt related to identifying valid English words. The student is using the GPT-3.5 & GPT-4 model, as indicated by the selected tab. The input text box contains a prompt that instructs the model to list valid English words from a series of mixed characters and strings. The input is not valid, so the GPT model is repeating back the mixed character and string input. At the bottom of the interface, token and character counts are displayed; in this instance, the input text contains 406 tokens and 625 characters. The "Clear" button can be used to remove all text in the main text box, and the "Show example" button will populate the text box with an example prompt., **[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image shows the OpenAI Platform interface with a text input area labeled for use with GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-3 (Legacy) models. The input area is populated with a comma-separated list of seemingly random strings, including alphanumeric combinations and some single characters, suggesting a user is experimenting with tokenization. Below the input area, the "Clear" and "Show example" buttons are visible along with the counts of "Tokens" (406) and "Characters" (625) derived from the text in the input area. The inclusion of many non-words might indicate a question regarding how the tokenizer handles unusual inputs, and the counts of tokens versus characters are displayed, aiding in the understanding of the tokenization process. This is likely a student question related to tokenizer behavior in LLMs. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image depicts a user interface from the OpenAI platform, specifically showcasing the token and character counts for a given text input, most likely for Large Language Model (LLM) usage. The UI displays a text area containing a seemingly random sequence of characters, numbers, and mixed-case strings like "eWHNetl, eGEjb, 9, kZFurXr, Pnti2d0, HnV66V0," suggesting it could be a test or example input. Below the text area are two buttons labeled "Clear" and "Show example" along with the counts: "Tokens: 406" and "Characters: 625." The user has selected "GPT-4o & GPT-4o mini" from the available model options, with tabs also visible for "GPT-3.5 & GPT-4" and "GPT-3 (Legacy)", indicating model compatibility testing. This UI likely supports tokenization and character counting, providing feedback useful when formulating prompts for the selected LLM. 2x" data-dominant-color="2B2B2C">Screenshot 2025-02-01 1806272458Ã—1183 284 KB
