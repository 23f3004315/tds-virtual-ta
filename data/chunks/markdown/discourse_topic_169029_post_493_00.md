## Post #493 by 23f3001764

**Direct Link**: [Post #493](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/169029/493)

@carlton @Saransh_Saini sir ,

I am writing to kindly request a re-evaluation of my Project 2 submission. As I had previously mentioned, the Render deployment link I submitted may take approximately **50 to 60 seconds** to activate upon the first load. This behavior is typical of free-tier deployments on Render, and I assure you that the application functions correctly in both **Podman** and **Linux** environments.

Upon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on **Railway** and submitted that link as well.

If possible, I kindly request either of the following:

Re-evaluation using the **Railway link** I provided, or
Re-evaluation using the **Render link**, with allowance for the 50â€“60 second activation time.

Your consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any further clarification or information is needed.

Thank you for your support and guidance.
