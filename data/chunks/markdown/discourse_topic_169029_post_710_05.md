The mailto link within the paragraph is correctly implemented with an anchor tag, creating a functional email link, whereas the first email display is only plain text within the `` tag.

The student's email address is displayed in an `` tag, as plain text, and as a mailto link within a `` tag. It suggests the student is trying to output their email address to the page, possibly for display or submission within the project requirements. The browser's developer tools were accessed by selecting "Elements" at the top of the page, allowing the student to inspect the generated HTML structure. Seeing the elements tab indicates that the student is debugging the html generation. 2x" data-dominant-color="F4F4F5">image1230Ã—422 40.7 KB
