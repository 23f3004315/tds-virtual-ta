**[Take Graded assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1) to check if you're ready for this course.** Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now.

**Programming skills are a pre-requisite**

You need a _good_ understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts.

**But isn't this a data science course?** Yes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don't just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.

In some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are, _some_ of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.

This course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you _do_ need programming to learn many of them.

**We encourage learning by sharing**

You _CAN_ copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).

**Why should you copy?** Because in real life, there's no time to re-invent the wheel. You'll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It's important to learn how to do that well.

**To learn well, understand** what you're copying. If you're short of time, prioritize.

**To learn better, teach** what you've learnt.
