**[Discussion Image by daksh76]** This image depicts a student's code and the output from running it within the TDS project 1 discussion thread, specifically focusing on formatting a Markdown file using Prettier. The `handle_task_A2` function checks if a file exists and then attempts to format it using the `npx prettier` command with a specified version. The output shows the "EXPECTED" and "RESULT" sections for the /data/format.md file, displaying Markdown content before and after the formatting attempt. The presence of the "EXPECTED" and "RESULT" sections indicate the file formatting was unsuccessful. The markdown file contains elements like lists, code snippets, and whitespace issues, intended for Prettier to resolve.ile using `prettier` if the file exists, otherwise raising a `FileNotFoundError`. The terminal output shows the "EXPECTED" and "RESULT" for formatting a Markdown file, indicating the formatting was not successful, despite the code seemingly finding the path. The student is likely debugging why `prettier` is not correctly formatting the Markdown file as expected, even though the code confirms that the file path exists. The discrepancy between the "EXPECTED" unformatted markdown and the "RESULT" suggests a potential issue with the `prettier` version specified or how the subprocess is being called." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="vmQ8BNdYH7yAYCyh6zn06I9QfB3" width="559" height="500" data-dominant-color="1D1D1D">image1027Ã—917 28.1 KB
