The UI allows searching by tag or digest, filtering, and previewing/deleting images. The image list displays digests (SHA256 hashes), tags (like "latest"), media type (Image), OS/ARCH (linux/amd64), size, last pushed date, and last pulled date for each image, indicating the current state of the repository's content. A "Docker commands" section is on the top right, displaying the "docker push pscodes24/dataworks-agent:tagname" command for pushing new tags. The student may be referring to discrepancies in the information displayed about these images, or is clarifying how to push new images to this repository. new to Docker. Navigation tabs like "General", "Tags", "Collaborators", "Webhooks", and "Settings" are visible, indicating the options available for managing the repository.

It shows the "Image Management" section in a Docker repository named "pscodes24/dataworks-agent". The UI includes tabs for General, Tags, Image Management (Beta), Collaborators, Webhooks, and Settings. Under the "Image Management" tab, there is a search bar for tags or digests and a filter option, with a table displaying existing images, their digests (e.g., sha256:6e6057d5a26), tags (e.g., latest), media type (Image), OS/ARCH (linux/amd64), size (e.g., 273.5 MB), when they were last pushed (e.g., about 1 month ago), and last pulled (e.g., 19 days ago). On the right side, "Docker commands" provide instructions on how to push a new tag to the repository using "docker push pscodes24/dataworks-agent:tagname". The primary focus is likely on understanding and managing Docker images within the project, indicating the discussion involves Docker-related challenges, which could be tagging, size and pushing/pulling the image., **[Discussion Image by 22f3000935]** This image captures a student's view of the Docker Hub repository named "pscodes24/dataworks-agent," specifically focusing on the "Image Management" tab. The repository contains two images, both based on linux/amd64 and last pushed about a month ago. The first image has a digest of sha256:6e6057d5a26 and is tagged as "latest," with a size of 273.5 MB and was last pulled 19 days prior. The second image has a digest of sha256:c9b258fe4894, with a size of 262.3 MB and was last pulled about a month ago. A "Docker commands" box on the right displays the command "docker push pscodes24/dataworks-agent:tagname" to guide users in pushing new tags to the repository. The student is likely exploring the Docker Hub interface and potentially facing issues with managing or pushing Docker images to the repository, which is why they posted it in a thread about project discrepancies. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f3000935]** This image depicts the "Image Management" tab within the Docker Hub repository "pscodes24/dataworks-agent," likely part of a student's project.
