**[Discussion Image by 23f2004837]** This image shows the browser address bar displaying the URL `https://23f2004837.github.io`. Below the address, the user's email `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` is displayed in large, bold text, followed by the same email address listed twice in normal font, with the second instance underlined as a hyperlink. The image suggests a student is attempting to access their Github Pages site associated with their TDS project, likely to verify successful deployment or view their project's web interface. This is part of peer discussion in the TDS Solver Project 2 discussion thread. The email address confirms the user is associated with DS Study IITM, helping to trace the issue back to the user's specific github repo setup.roject webpage, but instead only sees their email; they may need help debugging their GitHub Pages configuration. This is probably a student-posted image asking for help." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="bGH3hoatGWhn1RDy1R9O5GUcKKs" width="690" height="305" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2004837]** This image is a screenshot from a student's browser, displaying the student's email address "23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" multiple times on a webpage. The browser URL in the address bar is "https://23f2004837.github.io", suggesting the student has deployed their project (TDS Solver) on GitHub Pages. The repetition of the email may be unintentional, possibly due to a templating issue within the GitHub Pages deployment. Given the context of the TDS solver discussion, it is likely the student is sharing their deployed project for review or testing. This is likely peer discussion where the student is asking for others to review their live, github-hosted project., **[Discussion Image by 23f2004837]** This image shows the URL `https://23f2004837.github.io` loaded in a web browser, likely as part of a student discussion on the TDS Solver project. Below the URL is the student's email address `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` displayed twice, the second instance appearing as a clickable link. This suggests the student is likely troubleshooting how to access their deployed TDS Solver project, and this may be a screenshot shared for debugging the link or deployment status. The discussion thread focuses on student issues encountered during the project, with peers and instructors providing guidance, making this a case of peer or instructor assistance. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2004837]** This image shows the user interface of a web browser displaying the GitHub Pages site for the user "23f2004837," as evidenced by the URL `https://23f2004837.github.io` in the address bar. The page content shows the user's email address, "23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in," displayed in a large font at the top and twice again below in normal font, with the second instance hyperlinked. The context implies that the student is likely trying to access their Project 2 TDS Solver deployment, but encountering their email address instead of the expected solver application. This suggests a possible issue with the deployment configuration on GitHub Pages, such as an incorrect index file or missing build step. 2x" data-dominant-color="E8E9ED">image898Ã—398 28.9 KB
