Sir, a few things are not yet clear .

Jivraj:
[Quote]: 
file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA.

Some questions have **clickable html buttons**. When we click that, the zipfile or json file, or csv gets downloaded

Some questions have **image attached to the text**. For this, we have to use **right click â†’ download the image**. Here, the image is take from some url. For example. in GA2, q2, the image displayed is taken from **[Discussion Image by 23f2000573]** The image illustrates a simple scene likely related to a TDS Solver project, depicting basic geometric shapes on a black background. A red square and a green circle are positioned in the top half of the image, while a yellow triangle sits at the bottom. A horizontal blue line divides the upper and lower portions of the image, seemingly creating a ground plane. This likely demonstrates a basic TDS (Traffic Distribution System) scene setup with rudimentary elements, representing potential vehicles or objects within a simulation environment. The student likely uses this as a demonstration for visualization and collision detection. The scene highlights core visual concepts to be implemented in the TDS Solver project..

My doubt is, what will be the value of file attribute in curl command
