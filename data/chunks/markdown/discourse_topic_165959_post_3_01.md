**[Discussion Image by 22f3001315]** This image represents a student's question in a TDS discussion thread regarding GA4 data sourcing, specifically concerning JSON data. The student asks "What is the JSON data?" and presents a JSON snippet containing movie data with fields like "id," "title," "year," and "rating." The snippet includes the movie "1. Kiss and Kill" with a rating of 2.9. An error message, "Error: Expected: 2.9 Actual: 2.9," appears, indicating a potential confusion or unexpected comparison result related to the numerical rating field within the JSON data. This suggests the student is grappling with data type handling or validation within the GA4 context.JSON snippet with the keys "id", "title", "year", and "rating" having the values "tt7144296", "1. Kiss and Kill", 2017, and 2.9, respectively. There's also an error message, "Error: Expected: 2.9 Actual: 2.9," suggesting a potential data validation issue where the expected and actual values for rating are the same, but the system still flags it as an error, likely a data type issue or comparison problem. This indicates the student is having trouble understanding or processing the JSON data and its expected format or validation, which might be a confusion point in the learning guidance." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-01 132301" data-base62-sha1="ggpzqp3czDnsuhiswpKRL1wZ4" width="331" height="314">Screenshot 2025-02-01 132301331Ã—314 12.3 KB
