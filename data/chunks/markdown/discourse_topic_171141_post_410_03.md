The file structure includes configuration files like `.env`, `.markdownlint.json`, and `.prettierrc.json`, along with core Python files such as `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`. The repository also contains a `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, `LICENSE`, and `README.md`. The top of the repository indicates the student's username "Sharmilecholan" with a commit message "Delete evaluate.py", suggesting the student may be removing an "evaluate.py" file due to issues or instructions from the course.
