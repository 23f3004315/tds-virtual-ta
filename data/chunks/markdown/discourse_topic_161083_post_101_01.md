**[Discussion Image by 25ds1000038]** This image is part of an interactive exercise from the "GA1 - Development Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]" on AI editors, specifically Copilot and Cursor, noting their VS Code integration and function as LLM-powered code assistants. The exercise instructs students to install and run VS Code, then execute `code -s` in the terminal or command prompt, capturing the entire output. The image shows an empty text input field with a red border and error icon, indicating the student's previous attempt to answer "What is the output of `code -s`?" was marked "Incorrect. Try again," implying the student is having trouble getting the correct result from the command. This suggests a peer discussion or instructor help is needed to troubleshoot the student's understanding of the `code -s` command's output.Copilot to help write code faster." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="Ah6PqA81T0O019i0A3eDmOqCegu" width="690" height="202" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 25ds1000038]** This image depicts an interactive question related to using VS Code from the terminal in a TDS student discussion. It instructs the student to install VS Code, then run "code -s" in the terminal and paste the output. The question is, "What is the output of code -s?". The student has attempted to provide an answer, but the interface indicates "Incorrect. Try again." which suggests the system is expecting specific output and the provided answer doesn't match. The context also highlights the importance of AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot, emphasizing they're built on VS Code and should be utilized., **[Discussion Image by 25ds1000038]** This image shows a student attempting a challenge in a TDS discussion thread about development tools, specifically VS Code. The challenge requires the student to install and run VS Code, then execute the command `code -s` in their terminal or command prompt. The student is prompted to copy and paste the entire output of the command into a text box for evaluation. The image shows an empty text box outlined in red, along with the feedback "Incorrect. Try again.", indicating the student has not yet provided the correct output from the command. The instructions also mention AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot as tools to help write code faster. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 25ds1000038]** This image captures a student attempting an exercise within a TDS course module on "Development Tools," specifically concerning AI editors like Copilot and Cursor built on VS Code. The module instructs students to install and run Visual Studio Code, then execute the command `code -s` in their terminal or command prompt. The student is then asked to copy the entire output of the command into a text box, which has been outlined in red, indicating an incorrect answer. The prompt "Incorrect. Try again." is displayed below the text box, indicating that the student needs to re-execute the command and provide the correct output. This is likely a formative assessment question to ensure students can properly interact with VS Code from the command line. 2x" data-dominant-color="272A2F">image1590Ã—466 29.3 KB
