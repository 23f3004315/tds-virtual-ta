**[Discussion Image by 23f1002279]** This image shows a student encountering multiple errors while running a task involving credit card number extraction using an LLM. The initial error, an "HTTP 500 Internal Server Error," indicates that the image file specified in the task description (`C:\\Users\\starb\\Desktop\\tds_p_1\\data\\credit_card.png`) could not be found by the server, implying a file path issue. Subsequently, the system fails to read the output file `/data/credit-card.txt`, resulting in an "A8 failed: Cannot read" error, likely because the file was never created due to the earlier failure. Finally, there's an "HTTP 401 Unauthorized" error when trying to access the OpenAI embeddings endpoint, suggesting an authentication issue with the API key or access credentials. The errors suggest problems with both file handling and API authentication within the student's project setup.d image to an LLM, extracting the card number, and writing it to a file. The initial error (HTTP 500) reveals that the image file "credit_card.png" could not be found at the specified path on the student's local machine, which is causing the task to fail. Subsequently, the student encounters an "HTTP 404 Not Found" error when trying to read the output file and an "HTTP 401 Unauthorized" error when attempting to use the OpenAI embeddings API via a proxy, suggesting further configuration issues or missing authentication. The error messages "A8 failed: Cannot read /data/credit-card.txt" and "A9 failed: 'data'" likely stem from the initial file not found issue and a problem with API authentication, respectively." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="d80BbSQTNrgbeBjhu9MCwM8WE7Z" width="690" height="435" data-dominant-color="222222">image872Ã—550 16.5 KB
