## Post #680 by Anshul-IITM-DSA

**Direct Link**: [Post #680](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/169029/680)

I have completed and submitted the assigned project 2, and I have verified that it is working correctly as per the given instructions.

However, I noticed that the score awarded to me for the project is 0. I believe this may be an error, as my project meets the required criteria and functions as expected.

I kindly request you to review my submission and let me know if there was any issue during evaluation or submission that may have led to this result.

I have deployed the project on vercel as instructed.

I have uploaded all the links in google form and submitted it.

To support this, I am attaching a screenshot of the PowerShell window that shows an example of my application running successfully for one of the questions.
