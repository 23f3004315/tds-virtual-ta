Hi @21f3002158

I looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn’t click to submit button throughout the exam.

Since roe exam portal was similar to GA’s where you need to save answers using save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers.

There is no way other than pressing save button, we can’t do any help with this.

Kind regards
