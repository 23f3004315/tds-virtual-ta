. I want to understand whether this is just a wrong email I received or if there is an issue with your system’s evaluation. Please clarify this doubt, as I am unable to focus on my final term exam.

i closed my local machine too I spent one month on this project please consider my problem

**[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** This image depicts a student's Python script output related to Project 2 (TDS Solver) and is part of a peer discussion. The student ran "python uniu.py" from the "E:\data science tool\main\grok" directory. The script identifies 5 unique IP addresses and reports on each one. For each IP address, it shows the "Accessed endpoints: /api/" and the "API endpoint access count," listing the counts for the endpoints accessed by each IP (e.g., IP 43.230.106.157 has an access count of 93). The script then outputs "Total /api/ endpoint calls: 262" and "IPs accessing /api/ endpoint: 5," indicating the overall endpoint activity. This output helps in verifying if the IP addresses and API calls are parsed and counted correctly by the TDS Solver script.a dataset, along with the endpoint accessed (`/api/` in this case) and the number of times each IP accessed that endpoint. The output shows five unique IP addresses, their corresponding `/api/` access counts, and a total count of `/api/` endpoint calls (262) with 5 IPs accessing that endpoint. This illustrates a student's successful execution of their script, showcasing the data extraction and aggregation functionality for project requirements. The "PS E:\data science tool\main\grok>" shows the filepath of the executed python script." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="4uDk5NgjdkgupXsWRBF6oesPmOM" width="596" height="500" data-dominant-color="21262E">image706×592 10.1 KB
