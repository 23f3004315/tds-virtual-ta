It contains a list of student email addresses and associated error messages. Common errors include "taskA module missing," "app module missing," "flask module missing," "env file missing," "openai module missing," and "PhaseA module missing." Other errors specify technical issues like "application running on 5000 port," "SyntaxError: unmatched '", "Container was bound to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 which is why docker container port 8000 is not accessible outside(host os)," and "npx not found." The sheet is in "View only" mode and is likely being used by instructors or TAs to provide feedback to students.
