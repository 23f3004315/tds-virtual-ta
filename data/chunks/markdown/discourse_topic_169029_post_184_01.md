.load()`, it will throw an error. We need to first convert it into a JSON string and then load it using `json.loads( )`. For clarity I add image below.

This question has been stretched for too long—it’s not that big.

I guess @Jivraj is right.

**[Discussion Image by lakshaygarg654]** This image shows a student's code and the resolution of a `TypeError` when working with JSON in Python. Initially, the student tries to load `my_response` directly using `json.loads()`, but encounters the error "TypeError: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray". This error arises because `json.loads()` expects a string, bytes, or bytearray as input, but `my_response` is a Python dictionary. To fix this, the student uses `json.dumps()` to convert the Python dictionary `my_response` into a JSON string before passing it to `json.loads()`. The corrected code successfully prints the value associated with the "answer" key, which is "26272". Therefore, this is a peer discussion as the student figured it out themselves and showed the fix."the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray". To resolve this, the student correctly uses `json.dumps()` to first convert the Python dictionary `my_response` into a JSON string, and then uses `json.loads()` to parse the string back into a Python dictionary before accessing the "answer" key. The successful output of "26272" confirms the solution and demonstrates the proper use of `json.dumps()` before `json.loads()` when starting with a python dictionary. This highlights a common confusion point in JSON handling, requiring conversion to a string format before parsing." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="x7Ypv0bFNdyJj90O2vcCCyR5wMk" width="401" height="500" data-dominant-color="F3F3F4">image562×700 23.4 KB
