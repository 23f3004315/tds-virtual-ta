**[Discussion Image by 23f2003853]** This image depicts a student attempting to use a Vercel-deployed Python app and encountering a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error when trying to access the API endpoint. The assignment involves downloading a `q-vercel-python.json` file, deploying a Python app to Vercel, and creating an API endpoint that returns JSON responses based on names provided in the request. The instructions emphasize enabling CORS to allow GET requests and provide an example URL format: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`. The student has entered their specific Vercel URL (`https://tdsproject1-ltjsdpii1-23f2003853-projects.vercel.app/api`), but the fetch error suggests a problem with the server or the API endpoint. The discussion implies that the student is in the troubleshooting phase and needs to resolve the fetch error, potentially by checking CORS settings or verifying the API's functionality.l-python.json` file and exposing an API that returns JSON responses based on name parameters. The student is trying to determine their Vercel URL, which should resemble `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`. However, when accessing `https://tdsproject1-ltjsdpii1-23f2003853-projects.vercel.app/api`, they encounter a `TypeError: Failed to fetch` error, suggesting a potential problem with the deployed application or the URL construction, indicating the student is having trouble deploying and troubleshooting on Vercel. The CORS instructions are important because they must enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="32glmaeufkbxguhVz5MQk0iFNY" width="602" height="182">image602Ã—182 25.2 KB
