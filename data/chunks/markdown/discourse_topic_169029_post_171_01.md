 "file=@dcba.img"
`

At this moment it can’t be changed as I am occupied with other things. Please keep the question parameter as “question” and file parameter as “file” in the evaluation which is on the Project 2 page and the content type as multipart/form-data.

To clarify if I can handle any one of these 2 methods, I will be fine?

Edit:

Just now discovered that the field names are indeed “question” and “file” only in both the cases. Sorry for the oversight.
