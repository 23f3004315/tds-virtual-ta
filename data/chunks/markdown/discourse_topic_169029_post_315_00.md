Hi, I have a few things to say

My background :
I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term.

My Initial Disappointments with this Course
In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction):

The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.
