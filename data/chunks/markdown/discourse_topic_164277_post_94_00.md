I have done the a1 to a10 task and tried querying through localhost and its working fine basically all these ten steps but dont know whether its enough or not. also steps in phase B i am confused that should we create separate endpoints for these tasks or should it be with same /run endpoint and query. then will the input be random by any user. what about the output . where should it be given. phase b needs more explanation.
