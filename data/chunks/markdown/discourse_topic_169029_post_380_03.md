**[Discussion Image by ItsMeAlex]** This image depicts a student's interaction with a TDS Solver API endpoint using a tool like Postman or Insomnia, suggesting it is a peer discussion on project 2. The student is making a POST request to the `/api` endpoint at `104.211.116.95:8080` and including data in the `Body` formatted as `form-data`. The form-data consists of a `question` field, with the text "Sales Analytics at GlobalRetail Insights", and a `file` field, which is being set to a JSON file named `q-clean-up-sales-data (7).json` indicating that a file is being uploaded as part of the request. The server returns a `200 OK` status code with a JSON response `{ "answer": "10687" }`, which presumably solves the provided data and question. The tool's UI shows tabs for Params, Authorization, Headers, Body, Scripts, and Settings, which enables the student to configure and execute the API request and view the server response.n by directly sending the data to the API endpoint and inspecting the response received from the server. The cloud upload icon next to the filename indicates the file selected for upload is ready to be sent." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="maFVYUETrFzSJRdiTKkqqEPXnDP" width="690" height="321" srcset="**[Discussion Image by ItsMeAlex]** This image depicts a student's successful attempt to use Postman to interact with the TDS solver API for Project 2. The student has configured a POST request to `104.211.116.95:8080/api` with the `form-data` option selected in the "Body" section. The request includes two key-value pairs: `question` as text with the value "Sales Analytics at GlobalRetail Insights", and `file` as file type referencing "q-clean-up-sales-data (7).json". The server returned a `200 OK` status, and the JSON response in the "Body" section shows the answer as "10687". This indicates the student's API call and data upload were successful in obtaining the answer to the provided question and dataset., **[Discussion Image by ItsMeAlex]** This image depicts a student successfully sending a POST request to an API endpoint (104.211.116.95:8080/api) using Postman for TDS Project 2. The request includes 'question' and 'file' parameters. The 'question' parameter is set to "Sales Analytics at GlobalRetail Insights", and the 'file' parameter contains the 'q-clean-up-sales-data (7).json' file. The Postman interface displays the 'form-data' body with the specified key-value pairs, and the response body shows a JSON object: `{"answer": "10887"}`, with a status code of 200 OK. This indicates a successful API call and a correct answer being returned from the TDS solver. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by ItsMeAlex]** This image depicts a student's successful API call within a tool like Postman, as part of a TDS (likely "The Data Science") project, specifically Project 2. The student is using the POST method to send data to the endpoint "104.211.116.95:8080/api". The "Body" tab is selected, and the data is sent as "form-data," including a "question" with the value "Sales Analytics at GlobalRetail Insights" and a "file" named "q-clean-up-sales-data (7).json". The response body shows a JSON object containing the key "answer" with a value of "10887", indicating a successful API request and data processing with a "200 OK" status code and the request time of 3.68 seconds. The student interface shows the selected file with a cloud icon, indicating a successful file selection for upload. This represents a positive outcome where the student successfully interacted with the API to retrieve the correct answer. 2x" data-dominant-color="242525">image1384Ã—644 48 KB
