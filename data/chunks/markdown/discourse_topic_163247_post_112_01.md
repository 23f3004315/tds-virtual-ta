**[Discussion Image by Sudhishnarayan]** This image represents a student's question in the TDS discussion thread related to Large Language Models. The image shows a JSON formatted error message: `{"detail": "Method Not Allowed"}`. This indicates the student is encountering an issue related to HTTP request methods during the execution of their LLM-related code. The error suggests that the student is using an HTTP method that is not supported or allowed by the API endpoint they are trying to access. The student will likely need to review the API documentation to ensure they are using the correct method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for the specific operation. It could also indicate the wrong endpoint has been selected or that the student is trying to write where read only permissions exist.od Not Allowed"}` suggests the student is using an HTTP method (like POST, PUT, DELETE) that is not supported for the specific endpoint they are trying to access. This indicates a client-side coding issue related to how the API endpoint is being called. Students encountering this error should review the API documentation to ensure they're using the correct HTTP method for the desired operation. Understanding API method requirements is key to troubleshooting this problem, especially when building applications that interact with external services." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-05 205509" data-base62-sha1="fhWtoKzUlKtalblOtbgLWgL6u9m" width="299" height="47">
