Respected Team,

I received an email stating I failed to fulfil prerequisite and scored 0 because of it.

**[Discussion Image by 22f2000559]** This image shows a student's Project 1 prerequisite evaluation results, indicating that their submission will not be evaluated due to failing to meet the minimum requirements. The output shows individual checks: the Docker image is not present in Docker Hub or is not public ("FAIL"), while the Github repo, Dockerfile, and MIT license are present and public ("PASS"). Because the Docker image check failed, the overall "Prerequisites" check is marked as "FAIL," and the Project 1 score is 0. This output likely comes from an automated grading script or a similar evaluation tool used by the instructors. The student is facing an issue with making their Docker image public or correctly pushing it to Docker Hub. Dockerfile, and MIT license are all present and public, resulting in a PASS. Due to the Docker Hub failure, the overall prerequisites evaluation is FAIL, and the Project 1 score is 0, indicating the submission will not be evaluated further until resolved. This is a key evaluation step, implying that the student must successfully push the Docker image and make it public before the project can be assessed. The student needs to troubleshoot their Docker Hub configuration and ensure the image is correctly uploaded and made publicly accessible." alt="Screenshot 2025-04-01 132313" data-base62-sha1="6ls596muMFXc6CGVVeUMcWQYEP1" width="651" height="276">Screenshot 2025-04-01 132313651Ã—276 6.99 KB
