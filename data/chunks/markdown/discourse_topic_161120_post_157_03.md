 the requested student data. The purpose of this post is for the student to showcase the successful API call and its response within the ongoing class discussion. 2x" data-dominant-color="161616">Screenshot 2025-02-02 1948151140×975 20 KB

**[Discussion Image by 24f1002359]** This image captures a student's attempt to validate their FastAPI endpoint, which is causing a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error. The instructions state that the API should handle class-based filtering via query parameters (e.g., `/api?class=1A`). The student has entered `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` as their endpoint, but the "Check" button results in the fetch error, indicating a problem with the URL, server accessibility, or CORS configuration. The instructions also emphasize enabling CORS to allow GET requests from any origin, suggesting this may be a source of the error if not correctly configured. The system will test the URL by appending a `?class=...` query parameter to it and validating the response data.utton." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-02 194801" data-base62-sha1="favIOJ9kqsf1aLJGOItCPuLf1Aw" width="690" height="225" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 24f1002359]** This image depicts a student attempting to input the API URL endpoint for a FastAPI application within a testing interface, likely a learning module or assignment related to deployment tools. The student enters "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api" into the provided field, which is the default address and port for FastAPI. However, upon clicking "Check," a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error appears below the input box, indicating a problem with the provided URL. The instructions above highlight the need to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and provide an example of how to use the `class` query parameter. The "Check" button suggests an automated testing routine is verifying the correctness of the API endpoint and its response to query parameters., **[Discussion Image by 24f1002359]** This image captures a student's interaction with a FastAPI deployment assessment, showing a potential student question within a discussion thread. The task involves creating an API endpoint that filters students based on class using the `class` query parameter, exemplified with `/api?class=1A` and `/api?class=1A&class=1B`, while also requiring CORS to be enabled. The student inputs `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` as the API endpoint, which triggers a `TypeError: Failed to fetch` error when the "Check" button is clicked. This suggests the student's endpoint either isn't running or is inaccessible to the testing environment, and the system will attempt a request to this URL with `?class=...` to validate the response. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 24f1002359]** This image captures a student's attempt to provide the FastAPI endpoint URL for a class assignment, but encountering a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error, signaling a problem with retrieving data from the specified URL. The instructions state that the API should return students based on the 'class' query parameter (e.g., /api?class=1A), and CORS must be enabled. The student entered "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api" into a form field to be checked, and the error appears below the input box, meaning the automated check likely failed to connect to the API endpoint. The student will need to troubleshoot the API deployment, address the CORS configuration, and ensure the local server is running and accessible at the specified address and port before trying again by clicking the "Check" button. 2x" data-dominant-color="EAE9EA">Screenshot 2025-02-02 1948011626×531 38 KB
