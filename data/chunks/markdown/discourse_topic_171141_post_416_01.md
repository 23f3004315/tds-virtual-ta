**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image depicts a table extracted from a form response review, likely related to student submissions for Project 1 in the TDS course. The student, identified by the email 22f2000559@ds.study.iitm.ac.in, has two entries with slightly different timestamps (2/15/2025 and 2/16/2025). The table columns show "Timestamp", "Email Address", "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1?" and "What is the name of the image published on DockerHub?". The student provides GitHub repository links like "https://github.com/AnushkaAbhishekKumar/LLM-Project" and "https://github.com/AnushkaAbhishekKumar/LLM-Project/tree/main", along with DockerHub image names such as "coolsisters7/0c8a207a0c7c" and "coolsisters7/4a79a3c81cd0". The search box at the top "Q 22f2000559" indicates the form entries are filtered by the student's ID, suggesting the displayed information is from a single student's project submission.L" width="690" height="86" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image shows a section of a spreadsheet or database table presented in the TDS student discussion, specifically regarding Project 1 submissions. The table includes columns for Timestamp, Email Address, GitHub repository link, and the DockerHub image name. The student, identified by the email address "22f2000559@ds.study.itm.ac.in", has two entries, with submission timestamps on 2/15/2025 and 2/16/2025, pointing to GitHub repositories (one to the base repo, one to the /tree/main branch), along with associated DockerHub image names under the "coolsisters7" user. The search query used to filter this data is "22f2000559," which matches the student's email prefix. This information likely addresses questions about students' submissions, providing details about their GitHub and DockerHub resources for Project 1., **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image is a screenshot from a discussion board related to a project submission, specifically "Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies". It displays a table-like structure with columns: Timestamp, Email Address, GitHub Repository link, and DockerHub image name, showing submissions from student "22f2000559@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". The table shows two separate submissions for the same student, each with different timestamps, Github repository URLs, and DockerHub image names: coolsisters7/0c8a207a0c7c and coolsisters7/4a79a3c81cd0, respectively. The different URLs and names suggest the student might have updated their project. This looks like instructor checking the student's submissions and making notes on differences or potential issues. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image shows a snippet from a spreadsheet, likely an instructor's view of student submissions for Project 1 in the TDS course. The student's email "22f2000559@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" is highlighted via search bar, and there are two entries corresponding to this student, dated 2/15/2025 and 2/16/2025. The columns display the Timestamp, Email Address, the Github repository link (with the second entry pointing to the main branch), and the DockerHub image name (e.g., "coolsisters7/0c8a207a0c7c"). This data helps track student submissions of their code repositories and published Docker images. 2x" data-dominant-color="1A1F26">image1822Ã—229 20.1 KB
