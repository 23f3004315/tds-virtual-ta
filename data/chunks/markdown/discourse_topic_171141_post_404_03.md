**[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image captures a student's workspace in VS Code during a project setup phase, showing a mix of file exploration and terminal activity. The left panel displays the project directory "llmagent" with files like "app.py," "datagen.py," and a ".env" file; the ".env" file content includes an "AIPROXY_TOKEN" which seems to be a long JWT token. The terminal shows the successful execution of the command `git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent`, indicating that the student has cloned the project repository into their local "New folder (33)" directory. This implies the student is likely starting the project by setting up their environment and downloading necessary code, in a peer discussion or perhaps following instructor guidance.ining files like "app.py", "datagen.py", and a ".env" file. The ".env" file is open in the editor, revealing an "AIPROXY_TOKEN" variable containing a long, encoded string (likely a JWT). At the bottom, the integrated terminal displays the successful execution of the command `git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent`, indicating the student cloned the llmagent repository into their local "New folder (33)" directory. This is a student-driven action of setting up the project, and not a question or answer." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="22V3LBhcGLeGbfQ8Uw5xhgoYWD6" width="690" height="477" data-dominant-color="212121">image1041Ã—721 29.2 KB
