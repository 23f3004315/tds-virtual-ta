I used a python script to get the solution to quesiton 1 of week 6 graded assignment. It matches three options. Is this a bug or like we then need to analyze using the pearson coefficient to determine which option is the correct one

**[Discussion Image by AbhinavOhri]** This image shows a multiple-choice question from "Graded assignment 6," part of a student discussion on TDS. The question asks students to analyze the impact of mileage, average daily distance traveled, and engine capacity on price retention for Yamaha motorcycles in Delhi, using Pearson Correlation Coefficient, given they are a strategic consultant. The possible answers are correlation values for 'Mileage', 'AvgDistance' and 'EngineCapacity'. The user has selected 'EngineCapacity: 0.13' as their answer.ess. The specific objective is to determine the correlation coefficient associated with each factor, helping the student demonstrate their understanding of statistical analysis in a business context." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="qYtCOu4iFTJRgTpq1aybIwZqRVe" width="690" height="131" srcset="**[Discussion Image by AbhinavOhri]** This image shows a multiple-choice question from a graded assignment, where the student is asked to identify the factor (mileage, average distance, or engine capacity) that most influences motorcycle resale value in Delhi based on a Pearson correlation coefficient.
