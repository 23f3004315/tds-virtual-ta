output.txt` to format the README.md file and save it to "output.txt." Finally, they use `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 output.txt` to calculate the SHA256 hash of the "output.txt" file, displaying the algorithm, hash value, and file path in a tabular format. This suggests the student is experimenting with different tools for generating file hashes as part of their development tool exploration." data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/67clKoHAFVp2KRE9xkcn5lzTKhj.png?dl=1" title="image" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">**[Discussion Image by sarvan108]** This image captures a student's command-line activity in PowerShell within the "downloads" directory. The student first uses `certutil -hashfile` to generate the SHA256 hash of "README.md", which outputs the hash value "eef23369e30d7bd99173ef4988c65a59b80bf56f60da4c9ab95c1903be312317". Next, they use `npx` to run prettier on "README.md" and redirect the formatted output to "output.txt". Finally, the student uses `Get-FileHash` to compute the SHA256 hash of the "output.txt" file, resulting in a different SHA256 hash "CECFD0A2DC971DE14A28CABF98ED854A9E6C7A94BD788AB0D10F5D991A4FA054", demonstrating a different hash for the modified file. This sequence is likely part of a development task or a learning exercise related to hash generation and file manipulation.nloads" directory, then uses `certutil` to calculate the SHA256 hash of "README.md", producing the hash value "eef23369e30d7bd99173ef4988c65a59b80bf56f60da4c9ab95c1903be312317". Next, the student employs `npx` to run `prettier` on "README.md", redirecting the formatted output to a new file "output.txt". Lastly, `Get-FileHash` is used to calculate the SHA256 hash of "output.txt", resulting in the hash value "CECFD0A2DC971DE14A28CABF98ED854A9E6C7A94BD788AB0D10F5D991A4FA054". This example demonstrates how to calculate and compare file hashes before and after running a formatting tool." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="67clKoHAFVp2KRE9xkcn5lzTKhj" width="690" height="147" data-dominant-color="1E1E1E">image1677Ã—358 22.2 KB
