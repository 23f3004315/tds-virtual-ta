**[Discussion Image by 23f3002537]** This image captures a student working on a TDS assignment involving Large Language Models, specifically GA3 in January 2025. The student is attempting to implement a similarity matching endpoint and test it. The left side of the screen displays the assignment instructions, which include enabling CORS and using the API endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`. The right side shows VS Code, where the student is using Thunder Client to send a POST request to the endpoint with a JSON payload containing "docs" (an array of document contents) and a "query". The student is getting a "Got incorrect matches" error, despite the server showing a 200 OK response for the POST request, and the Thunder Client window showing what seems like the correct match order.right side displays the student's Thunder Client setup in VS Code, making a POST request to the same URL with a JSON body containing a "docs" array of three document contents and a "query" string. The server responds with a status code of 200 OK but returns the matches in the wrong order: "Contents of document 1", "Contents of document 2", "Contents of document 3". The terminal output indicates the Uvicorn server is running successfully and processing POST requests to `/similarity`, suggesting the issue lies in the ranking logic within the student's implementation and not the server setup itself." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="1VKtaTrHja4AY8B9OteLkA2vESC" width="690" height="359" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f3002537]** This image captures a student facing an issue during a TDS exam in January 2025, specifically with GA3 (Large Language Models) assessment. The student is attempting to implement a similarity endpoint, indicated by the URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`. The left side of the image shows the exam instructions stating "Contents of document 3" should be the closest match, followed by "Contents of document 1", then "Contents of document 2," and emphasizing CORS enablement. The student's submission receives an "Error: Got incorrect matches," likely because the returned matches are not in the expected order. The right side of the image displays the code running in VS Code, where a POST request with a JSON body containing documents and a query is sent to the local server and returns a `200 OK` status with the incorrectly ordered matches. The terminal output shows Uvicorn running the server, confirming the API is accessible but not returning the desired output., **[Discussion Image by 23f3002537]** The image captures a student's attempt to answer a question in the "GA3 - Large Language Models" assignment, specifically relating to the API endpoint `/similarity`. The student enters the correct URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`) but receives an "Incorrect Matches" error. The error box indicates the importance of CORS settings (allowing OPTIONS and POST methods), and the backend is checked via a POST request with a JSON body containing documents and a query. On the right side of the image, the student uses Thunder Client to send a POST request with the correct JSON payload and endpoint; the response returns a 200 OK with a "matches" list. Despite this, the assignment checker on the left indicates that the matches are incorrect, likely pointing to a mismatch between the expected output and the actual returned values by the LLM or a subtle error elsewhere in the student's implementation that needs further debugging. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f3002537]** This image shows a student's attempt to pass an automated assessment in a TDS course (likely the GA3 assignment). The student is prompted to provide the correct API endpoint for a similarity matching service. The student has entered "http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity," but the check returns an error: "Got incorrect matches." The instructional text also advises enabling CORS for OPTIONS and POST methods. On the right side of the image is Thunder Client sending a POST request to the API with a JSON payload of documents and a query string and getting a 200 OK response, but not the expected matches. A python uvicorn server is running in the terminal. The server appears to be running correctly, but the response received doesn't result in the correct matches as expected by the autograder, indicating a potential logical flaw or subtle difference from the expected outcome. The student has 7/9.5 points remaining with about 2 hours and 10 minutes left in the assessment. 2x" data-dominant-color="1A2020">image1915Ã—999 143 KB
