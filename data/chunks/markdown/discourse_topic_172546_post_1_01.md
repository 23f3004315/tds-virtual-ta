**[Discussion Image by Sagan]** This image shows a TDS (Tools in Data Science) student question in a practice quiz setting, presented as a simulated "Student-ChatGPT Discussion Thread." The student seeks help understanding how to use the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two locations specified by their latitude and longitude coordinates: Location A (Latitude: 40.748817, Longitude: -73.985428) and Location B (Latitude: 40.761293, Longitude: -73.982294). The quiz platform, accessed via a URL "quizpractice.space," presents an "End Term Quiz" for the subject "TDS" with total marks of 40, and is in "Learning Mode." The student is on question number 1 out of 40. The background information introduces the Haversine formula and sets the stage for a step-by-step solution presumably provided by ChatGPT in the subsequent (unseen) part of the discussion.985428) and Location B (Latitude = 40.761293, Longitude = -73.982294). The student is seeking guidance on applying the Haversine formula to determine the distance between these two points. The quiz interface shows question navigation buttons for questions 1 to 40, with question 1 currently selected." alt="Screenshot (883)" data-base62-sha1="xFWew9yxXiAf0RYldrLYeK0vB5D" width="690" height="388" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Sagan]** This image shows a quiz platform question presenting a student-ChatGPT discussion thread about using the Haversine formula for distance calculation. The quiz is from an "End Term Quiz" for the "TDS" subject, worth 40 marks, and is identified as "2024 Dec22: IIT M FN EXAM QDD2." The student seeks help in understanding the step-by-step application of the Haversine formula to find the distance between two locations (A and B) given their latitudes and longitudes. The student's inquiry initiates a problem-solving process, as they're encountering difficulty in using the formula which aims to solve a question in Graded Assignment 6. The navigation shows "Exam Mode" and "Learning Mode" options, suggesting that this is a practice question., **[Discussion Image by Sagan]** The image depicts a student question on the TDS (Tools in Data Science) Discourse forum, specifically focusing on a problem involving the Haversine formula, which is used for distance calculation. The context is an end-term quiz with the subject TDS, total marks 40, and QP 2024 Dec22 IIT M FN EXAM QDD2, viewed in learning mode on "quizpractice.space". The student is seeking assistance with a step-by-step guide on applying the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two locations, Location A (Latitude = 40.748817, Longitude = -73.985428) and Location B (Latitude = 40.761293, Longitude = -73.982294), in relation to a graded assignment. The question is presented as a transcript of a hypothetical "Student-ChatGPT Discussion Thread," where the student asks ChatGPT for help. The student is trying question 1 on a quiz with 40 questions total. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Sagan]** This image shows part of a TDS (Tools in Data Science) student discussion thread regarding the "PYQ Haversine" problem, framed as a conversation between a student and ChatGPT to solve a Graded Assignment 6 question. The question involves calculating the distance between two locations (Location A: Latitude = 40.748817, Longitude = -73.985428 and Location B: Latitude = 40.761293, Longitude = -73.982294) using the Haversine formula. The student is asking for a step-by-step explanation of how to apply the Haversine formula. The context is within an "End Term Quiz" environment, in learning mode, and the quiz is identified as "2024 Dec22: IIT M FN EXAM QDD2," with a total marks of 40.
