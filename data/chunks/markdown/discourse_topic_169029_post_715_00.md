**Subject:** Request to Share My Student-Built TDS Assistant Platform

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope you’re doing well.

I’m **Vicky Kumar**, a student from the Data Science and Applications program at **IIT Madras**. Over the last few months, I’ve built a personal project called **“Vicky App”** — a smart assistant platform specifically designed to help students in courses like **TDS,**.

The system is capable of:

Accurately solving over **90% of assignment-style questions** using regex and phonetic matching
Dynamically executing the right code logic based on the student’s input
Processing uploaded files such as Excel, PDF, CSV, and JSON
Delivering instant answers, completely independent of ChatGPT or any external LLM

You can test the platform here: https://app.algsoch.tech

What’s in it for students:

They type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically
Especially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload
I’ve made it **free for the first 3 questions**
After that, students can access the full platform for just **₹199/month**, which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs
