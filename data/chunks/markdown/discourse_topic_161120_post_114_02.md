 that the response data matches what is expected. This implies a problem with how the student is constructing the API call or with the data accessible via the API at that endpoint. 2x" data-dominant-color="FAF2F3">image1660×325 47.3 KB

**[Discussion Image by 24ds1000082_Vivek]** This image captures a student's question within the TDS student discussion forum on deployment tools. The image displays a web browser window showing the JSON output from a local API endpoint `127.0.0.1:8000/api`, with query parameters `class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`. The JSON response is a list of student objects, each containing `studentId` (an integer) and `class` (a string), and seems to correctly filter students belonging to classes 5N, 1T, 11P, and 9W based on the query parameters. This indicates a successful API call based on the given filter conditions, which likely prompts the student's question within the discussion thread about the expected output.ir post to show that they successfully retrieved the filtered data or to ask a question about the API response structure or filtering mechanism." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="iTYjPpXZqkgsi7YHn2MdNvQ3pY1" width="690" height="93" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 24ds1000082_Vivek]** This image captures a student query to an API and the returned JSON response within the context of a TDS (The Data Science) discussion forum related to deployment tools. The student, Vivek, is querying a local API endpoint at `127.0.0.1:8000/api` with multiple class parameters appended to the URL as query parameters (`class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`). The API returns a JSON array of student objects, each containing a "studentId" (number) and a "class" (string), representing data filtered by the provided class values in the URL. The student appears to be testing filtering capabilities by passing multiple class values. The image gives the raw JSON output in the browser., **[Discussion Image by 24ds1000082_Vivek]** This image captures a student's query within the TDS "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion thread, specifically showing how to retrieve student data filtered by class using an API endpoint. The student is attempting to filter by multiple class values in a single API call. The browser address bar shows the API endpoint is `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`, indicating the student is passing multiple `class` parameters. The response from the API is a JSON array where each object contains a `studentId` and a `class` attribute. This JSON response confirms that the API call is returning data for students in all the specified classes (5N, 1T, 11P, and 9W), displaying student ID's and their respective classes. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 24ds1000082_Vivek]** This image shows the output of a student's API call in a web browser, likely as part of a deployment tools discussion related to GA2. The URL in the address bar is `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`, indicating that the student is querying a local server on port 8000, specifically the `/api` endpoint, and is passing multiple `class` parameters in the query string, attempting to filter by class. The response body, formatted in JSON, shows an array of student objects, each containing `studentId` and `class` attributes (e.g., `{"studentId": 57, "class": "5N"}`). This suggests the student is trying to retrieve students belonging to multiple classes using a single API call, and this is the data returned by the server based on that query. This could reflect a question on how to properly filter based on multiple parameters and how the API is processing them. 2x" data-dominant-color="EBECED">image1792×244 33.8 KB
