## Post #646 by afsalshah

Sorry, Sir. I just realized the reason why my submission was not considered â€” I had used the email ID I created specifically for my MAD2 project. It was a genuine mistake on my part. However, I noticed in a previous thread that another student who submitted using a different email ID was given a chance to update it. I kindly request you to consider giving me the same opportunity as well.

I have given my endpoint to the gform circulated in this thread.
