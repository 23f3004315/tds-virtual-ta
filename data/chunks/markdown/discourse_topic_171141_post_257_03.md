**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image depicts a student's issue accessing a Docker Hub project, specifically at the URL `https://hub.docker.com/r/vedant2204/project/tags`, indicating a problem with image tagging. The screenshot reveals a "404 Oops! The page you have requested was not found" error on Docker Hub. The user likely navigated to the project's tag page, but it's either not published or doesn't exist under the specified user (`vedant2204`) and project name. This points to a potential discrepancy between the project setup, publishing process, and the intended URL. The discussion is centered on troubleshooting issues students face with the class project, which may include image tags.ntial issue with repository setup, permissions, or the existence of the specified project and tag on Docker Hub. The image confirms that the student navigated to Docker Hub's "Explore" section and attempted to access a specific repository." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="2zNfglZ6jA6ItUzOzMLVUXP9LMw" width="690" height="336" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image depicts a 404 error encountered on Docker Hub, specifically while trying to access the "tags" page for the repository "vedant2204/project." The user has navigated to the URL https://hub.docker.com/r/vedant2204/project/tags, and the webpage displays the message "404 Oops! The page you have requested was not found," suggesting either the repository or the specified tag page does not exist or is not publicly accessible. This indicates a student may be trying to access a Docker Hub repository for a project and is facing issues with its availability or visibility settings. The student appears to be logged in as indicated by the "J" profile icon in the upper right, meaning access problems are not due to lacking authentication, but rather the repository itself. Troubleshooting would involve verifying the correct repository name, its existence, and the user's permissions to view it., **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image captures a student's (vedant2204) difficulty in accessing a project on Docker Hub, resulting in a 404 "Oops! The page you have requested was not found" error. The screenshot is taken from the student's web browser, showing the Docker Hub interface with the "Explore" and "My Hub" tabs and the URL `https://hub.docker.com/r/vedant2204/project/tags` in the address bar. The user is attempting to navigate to the "tags" section of a project under the username "vedant2204," but the page is not found. This indicates a potential issue with the project's existence, visibility, or the correctness of the URL entered. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image captures a student's encounter with a 404 error page on Docker Hub, indicating that a specific page or resource they were trying to access, located at "https://hub.docker.com/r/vedant2204/project/tags", was not found. The student, vedant2204, was navigating through their Docker Hub repository when this error occurred, as indicated by the breadcrumb navigation showing "Explore / vedant2204 / project". The error message "404 Oops! The page you have requested was not found" clearly identifies the problem as a missing resource. This situation likely represents a point of confusion in a student project discussion, needing guidance on resolving a broken link or missing Docker Hub resource. 2x" data-dominant-color="154061">image1885Ã—918 92 KB
