## Post #63 by 22f2001640

Issue resolved for me after following below step

After creating the workflow:

Trigger the workflow and wait for it to complete
Ensure it appears as the **most recent action** in your repository
Verify that it creates a commit during or within 5 minutes of the workflow run
