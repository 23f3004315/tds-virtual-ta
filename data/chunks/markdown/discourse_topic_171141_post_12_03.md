**[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image captures a terminal output showing the successful execution of a `podman run` command within a student project discussion. The command `podman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 047fa151bf43` is used to start a container, setting an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` and mapping port 8000. The subsequent INFO messages indicate the server process started, the application startup completed, and Uvicorn is running on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`, instructing the user to press CTRL+C to quit. This suggests a peer discussion where the student is showing their successful container setup. The output provides a confirmation that the container is running as expected, with the Uvicorn server active and accessible via the specified port.ng process. This context is important because it reveals that the student has at least started the containerized application, and is probably facing a different set of problems now like access or proper functioning of the application." alt="Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 12.53.35 AM" data-base62-sha1="aEKJ3xEMEb2zZOOQ8zF6qW7COTU" width="690" height="95" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image shows a terminal output from a student executing a `podman run` command as part of a TDS project, likely a peer discussion involving running containers. The command `podman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 047fa151bf43` is used to run a container, sets an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN`, and maps port 8000 on the host to port 8000 in the container using the image ID `047fa151bf43`. After executing this command, the logs displayed indicate "Started server process," "Waiting for application startup," and "Application startup complete," confirming that the Uvicorn server is running inside the container and is accessible at `http://0.0.0.0:8000`. This confirms the containerized application has started successfully and suggests the student is past an initial setup or troubleshooting step. The prompt "Press CTRL+C to quit" informs the user how to stop the running container process., **[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image shows a terminal output representing a successful startup of the Uvicorn server using Podman, likely as part of a student's project setup. The student used the command `podman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 047fa151bf43` to run a container, setting the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable and mapping port 8000 of the container to port 8000 of the host. The output confirms that the server process started, the application startup completed, and Uvicorn is now running on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`, indicating it's accessible, and it also reminds the user they can stop the server using `CTRL+C`. This is likely a peer sharing their successful outcome as guidance for other students facing similar setup issues, serving as a model for correct execution. The success is based on correct usage of the podman run command to set enviornment variables and ports. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image shows a student's terminal output demonstrating a successful execution of a `podman run` command, likely for running a containerized application as part of the project. The command includes flags for automatically removing the container upon exit (`--rm`), setting an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` by referencing an environment variable with the same name (`-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`), and mapping port 8000 of the host to port 8000 of the container (`-p 8000:8000`), followed by the container image ID `047fa151bf43`. The subsequent output confirms that the server process started, the application startup completed successfully, and Uvicorn, an ASGI server implementation, is running on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`, indicating the application is accessible on the specified port, also providing the user instructions to use CTRL+C to quit. This output suggests that the student's container setup and execution were successful, and therefore this is likely showing successful troubleshooting or guidance. The image provides a verification point for other students who encounter similar issues during container execution, showcasing the expected output when the application is running correctly inside the container, confirming AIPROXY_TOKEN is correctly configured. 2x" data-dominant-color="323232">Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 12.53.35 AM1220Ã—169 25.8 KB
