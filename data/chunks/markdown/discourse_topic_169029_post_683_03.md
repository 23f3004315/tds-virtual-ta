**[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image depicts a student's request to the TDS solver API using a tool like Postman, showcasing a test case for error handling. The student is sending a POST request to "https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/" with the "form-data" content type. The request includes two key-value pairs: "question" with the value "What is the value in the 'answer' column of the...", and "file" with the value "def.zip," where the zip file contains a CSV file with only column headers and no data values. The student expects the API to return a JSON response with the error message "Answer column not found or empty," indicating the system correctly identifies the absence of data in the specified column. This demonstrates a student validating the API's ability to handle edge cases where the requested column is empty or nonexistent.is showcases a peer discussion where the student shares their test setup, inputs and the expected/received output related to error handling." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="vkt2pl0Sz4HI5XoYM7CMHqXS0tP" width="690" height="330" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image depicts a student's interaction with the TDS solver API using a tool like Postman to test error handling. The student is sending a POST request to `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` with form-data. The request includes a 'question' parameter with the value "What is the value in the 'answer' column of the..." and a 'file' parameter, which is a zip file named "def.zip" containing a CSV file that only has column names and no data values. The student is testing the scenario where the 'answer' column is empty, and the expected JSON response is an error message: `"error": "Answer column not found or empty."`. This confirms that the student is verifying the correct error response is returned when the answer column in the CSV file is empty., **[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image depicts a student's attempt to test the TDS Solver project using a POST request to the `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` endpoint. The student is using the `form-data` format and includes two parameters: `question` with the value "What is the value in the 'answer' column of the..." and `file` uploading "def.zip," which they describe as containing a new CSV file with only column names and no data values. The student aims to trigger a specific error and the JSON response received is `{"error": "Answer column not found or empty."}`. The student annotates that this is the "Expected error answer :)," which indicates successful execution of this particular test case. The interface appears to be a tool like Postman or Insomnia. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image captures a student's interaction with the fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/ endpoint via a POST request, seemingly as part of the TDS Solver Project 2 discussion. The student is attempting to upload a zip file (def.zip) containing a new CSV that only includes column names without any values, aiming to trigger a specific error. The POST request includes a "question" field with the value "What is the value in the "answer" column of the...". The student anticipated, and received, the JSON response: `{"error": "Answer column not found or empty."}`. This indicates a successful test case where the application correctly identifies the absence of data in the 'answer' column. 2x" data-dominant-color="F9F7F7">image1940×928 137 KB
