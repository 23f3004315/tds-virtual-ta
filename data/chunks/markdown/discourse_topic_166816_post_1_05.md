**[Discussion Image by HARISH.S]** This image depicts a student's view of their graded assignment dashboard, likely related to a discussion forum ("Discourse") activity, potentially showing incorrect or missing scores. A banner indicates "Bonus marks for posting on Discourse," specifying that IITM BS students receive a bonus mark for relevant questions or replies on the "GA4 - Data Sourcing" discussion thread. The dashboard displays the student's login information (23f3000975@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) with a logout button, and a "Recent saves" section which displays a list of scores with timestamps (e.g., "from 9/2/2025, 8:04:05 pm. Score: 8"), with a note "(most recent is your official score)". The top of the interface shows an "Ended at" timestamp (Sun, 9 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST) and current listed "Score: 0" along with "Check all" and "Save" buttons, seemingly indicating a discrepancy between the recent saves and the current score. The student has hand-written "week 4" in the middle of the screen, possibly as a reminder of the assignment's context.="320" srcset="**[Discussion Image by HARISH.S]** This image depicts a student's view of a graded assignment dashboard, specifically regarding a "Bonus marks for posting on Discourse" assignment related to the "GA4 - Data Sourcing" discussion thread for TDS Jan 2025.

A handwritten "week 4" is superimposed on the image, potentially indicating the assignment's timeframe within the course.

The dashboard indicates the assignment ended on February 9, 2025, and currently displays a "Score: 0", although the "Recent saves" section shows previous scores of 4 and 8 from earlier saves/submissions on February 2, 2025.
