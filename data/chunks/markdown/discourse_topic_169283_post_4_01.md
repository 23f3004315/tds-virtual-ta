**[Discussion Image by 23f2005138]** This image depicts a graded assignment question in a TDS (presumably, a machine learning or data science) course, showing a multiple-choice selection. The radio button next to "'AvgDistance: -0.05'" is selected, implying the student chose this option. Other options are "'Mileage: 0.95'", "'Mileage: 0.21'", and "'EngineCapacity: 0.17'". The nature of the question requires the student to select one value among mileage, average distance, and engine capacity, with associated numerical values, presumably related to some data transformation or model output.nding numerical values: 'Mileage: 0.95', 'AvgDistance: -0.05' (which is currently selected), 'Mileage: 0.21', and 'EngineCapacity: 0.17'. The presence of the radio buttons suggests this is a single-selection question, potentially asking the student to identify a specific feature based on a criterion not visible in the image, such as finding the feature with the lowest or highest value. The negative value for 'AvgDistance' might be a key element to consider for the correct answer. Without the actual question prompt, it is challenging to ascertain the exact problem the student is trying to solve." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="nPaaIWtriJMunrro5mxPkkzgs0I" width="281" height="219">image281Ã—219 9.1 KB
