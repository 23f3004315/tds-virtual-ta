@carlton and @jivraj,

Hello.. I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesnâ€™t even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying..
