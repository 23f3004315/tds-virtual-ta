**[Discussion Image by 23f2004752]** The image depicts a student's troubleshooting process within the "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent" discussion thread, showing a browser displaying "{\"detail\":\"Not Found\"}" at `http://localhost:5000`, indicating a failed API endpoint. The code in `app.py` reveals a FastAPI setup, with a route defined for `/` that should return "Hello from the Automation Agent!". An `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable check is present, and the student has apparently pushed changes to GitHub, as indicated by the `git push origin main` output in the terminal, implying they were working on the project and committing updates. The "Not Found" error suggests the student might have tried to access an endpoint that wasn't defined or started the server incorrectly, or that the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` check is failing and preventing the root endpoint from being served. The student needs to verify their FastAPI server is running correctly and that all necessary environment variables are set before testing the endpoints in their browser.ly exposed or accessible, leading to the 404 error in the browser." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-13 165912" data-base62-sha1="yO2xtMBVAwea8Bpo3rTBKumTB5U" width="690" height="368" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2004752]** This image captures a student encountering a "Not Found" error while trying to access the root endpoint of their FastAPI application in a TDS project. The student is attempting to access "http://localhost:5000" in their browser, but receives the error message `{"detail":"Not Found"}`. The student's `app.py` code includes a root endpoint defined with `@app.get("/")`, which should return `{"message": "Hello from the Automation Agent!"}`. The code also shows an environment variable check for `AIPROXY_TOKEN`, and the terminal shows a successful `git push origin main` command, indicating the student has pushed their code. The student likely has a configuration issue preventing the correct route from being accessed, possibly because the FastAPI server isn't running properly or the route is not correctly registered., **[Discussion Image by 23f2004752]** The image shows a student's debugging process for a FastAPI application in the "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent." On the left, a browser window displays the message `{"detail":"Not Found"}` when accessing `http://localhost:5000`, indicating a routing issue. On the right, the `app.py` file is open in VS Code, revealing API endpoints defined using `@app.get("/")` and `@app.delete("/delete")`. It also shows the code related to setting up logging and checking for an `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable, including raising an exception if it's missing. The terminal output shows a successful `git push origin main`, which doesn't directly relate to the routing error but indicates the student is managing their code with Git. The error suggests that either the root route ("/") or the path `/delete` is not being properly accessed or the server isn't correctly routing the requests. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2004752]** This image depicts a student's debugging process for a FastAPI application within the "LLM-based Automation Agent" project. The student is encountering a "Not Found" error when accessing the `/` route in their browser (localhost:5000). The `app.py` code shows the `read_root` function defined for the `/` route, intended to return "Hello from the Automation Agent!". The code also reveals the use of an `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable, raising an exception if it's not set. The terminal output confirms a successful `git push origin main`, indicating the code is pushed to GitHub and likely free of git errors. Troubleshooting will probably involve verifying the FastAPI server is running correctly and that the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable is properly configured if required by the application's current state. 2x" data-dominant-color="1E1E1F">Screenshot 2025-02-13 1659121917×1024 124 KB
