**Q1: My screen is visible?**

**A1:** Yes, your screen is visible.

**Q2: I posted on Discourse and emailed you about a problem deploying a Flask application on Vercel. The Flask module is not getting downloaded. Can you show the vercel.json configuration file?**

**A2:** The error likely stems from your `requirements.txt` file. Did you create a new virtual environment for this project, or did you install Flask on your global environment? When deploying Flask applications on Vercel, you need to keep a few things in mind. I'll show you how to create a `requirements.txt` file without manually typing it.
