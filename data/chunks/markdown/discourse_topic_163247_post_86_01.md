**[Discussion Image by Sudhishnarayan]** This image depicts a student's attempt to call a function endpoint named "calculate_performance_bonus" using a local server (127.0.0.1:8001). The student has encoded the function call along with arguments in the URL query string, specifically "Calculate performance bonus for employee 10056 for 2025". The JSON payload shows the function name and arguments passed, {"name":"calculate_performance_bonus", "arguments":"{\"employee_id\": 10056, \"current_year\": 2025}"}, which includes the employee ID and current year, indicating a request related to calculating an employee's performance bonus for the year 2025. It is a student's query to an API endpoint likely hosted on their local machine during a development or testing phase of the GA3 Large Language Models project. The "Pretty-print" option suggests the response is formatted for readability, indicating a debugging context.s%20for%20employee%2010056%20for%202025."` shows a call to the `/execute` endpoint with a query parameter `q` that defines the function to run and its arguments. Below the URL, the image displays the JSON payload being sent, which specifies the function name as `"calculate_performance_bonus"` and the arguments as `{"employee_id": 10056, "current_year": 2025}`. This format suggests the student is likely experimenting with calling an LLM function via a local server to calculate a performance bonus for an employee for a specific year, indicating a troubleshooting step or validation during the TDS course. The "Pretty-print" option shown could format the JSON payload, possibly for better readability." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-04 232048" data-base62-sha1="vDDmPx3om4RUpkF0qhoHEFiy9QH" width="690" height="79" data-dominant-color="2F2726">Screenshot 2025-02-04 2320481322Ã—152 8.42 KB
