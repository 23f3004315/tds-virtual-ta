**[Discussion Image by 23f2003853]** This image is from a TDS student discussion thread regarding deployment tools, specifically Vercel. The screenshot displays the output from a deployed application, accessed via a Vercel URL: `tdsproject1-tjsdpi1-23f2003853.projects.vercel.app/api?name=sLrAoQ&name=d2KY`. The output, likely a JSON response, shows `"marks": [1, 41]`. The student likely wants to confirm if their deployment is successful and if the API endpoint is returning the expected data. The "Pretty-print" checkbox implies the student may be looking for a more readable format of the JSON response.app displays the JSON output `{"marks":[1,41]}`, visible in the browser. The URL shows the Vercel deployment address, `tdsproject1-tjsdpi1-23f2003853-projects.vercel.app`, along with API query parameters: `api?name=sLrAoQ&name=d2KY`. The "Pretty-print" checkbox is displayed above the JSON output. This shows the student observing the API's output after deployment, likely troubleshooting or confirming expected behavior." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="moC9B9SY1xNjQz5KoftA9zf5bwH" width="602" height="102">image602Ã—102 14.9 KB
