**[Discussion Image by Divya1]** This image depicts a user registration form, specifically focused on the password and username fields, indicating a student question about account setup during the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion. The password field is filled, and the displayed validation message indicates that it should be either at least 15 characters long, or at least 8 characters including both a number and a lowercase letter. The username field contains "navya", but an error message, "Username navya is not available," appears below it, suggesting that the chosen username is already taken, and three available alternatives are offered: "navya-stack," "navya-cmyk," or "navya856." This scenario demonstrates a common account creation problem where desired usernames are already in use, requiring users to select different usernames, which in this case are generated by the system as suggestions.e system suggests alternatives: "navya-stack", "navya-cmyk", or "navya856." The password field requires either at least 15 characters or at least 8 characters with a number and lowercase letter. This indicates the student needs to select an available username from the suggestions or try another unique username." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="wSoW4EMugqQzVyoIWZBMkwLcMhM" width="594" height="296">image594×296 15.8 KB
