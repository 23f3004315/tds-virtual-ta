**[Discussion Image by 22f3000276]** This image shows an instructor's response regarding Project 1 scores, specifically focusing on pre-requisite checks and log availability. The student's repositories (GitHub and Docker) passed the pre-requisite checks, including timestamp before Feb 18th, LICENSE existence, and Dockerfile existence. However, the task score is 0 and bonus is 1, resulting in a P1 score of 1, and a final score calculated using MIN(20, task score + bonus). Importantly, the response clarifies that evaluation logs are only available if the API service started within 5 minutes; otherwise, only docker logs are provided for diagnosis. and a P1 score of 1. The message clarifies that evaluation logs are only available if the API service started within 5 minutes; otherwise, only Docker logs are provided, and that `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` are available for learning and debugging." alt="WhatsApp Image 2025-04-07 at 15.39.10_edb0b829" data-base62-sha1="rRl3HrYSFSFmf26O3wu1Q3zbxBC" width="225" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f3000276]** This image shows an instructor's feedback on a student's project submission in the TDS-official-Project1-discrepancies discussion. The image displays the submitted GitHub and Docker repository links, followed by prerequisite checks, indicating that the Docker and GitHub repos exist, are public, have timestamps before February 18th, a LICENSE file exists (MIT License), and a Dockerfile exists. The table of zeros shows that the student did not receive any points for any task, but did receive a bonus of 1, giving them a P1 score of 1. Crucially, the message explains that evaluation logs are provided if the API service starts within 5 minutes; otherwise, only a Docker log is available, and it encourages students to use evaluate.py and datagen.py files for debugging, and it points to the Docker and Evaluation logs to help diagnose issues., **[Discussion Image by 22f3000276]** This image shows a student's project feedback within the TDS discussion forum. The feedback includes the student's Github and Docker repository submissions, along with the results of pre-requisite checks (Docker repo exists and is public, Github repo exists and is public, license exists, and Dockerfile exists) that all passed with a value of '1'. The student's task score is 0, bonus is 1, and P1 score is 1, and the final t score calculation is based on MIN (20, (task score + bonus)). The grading grid shows that most of the coding tasks got score '0'. The post indicates that Docker logs and evaluation logs are attached and explains that evaluation logs are only available if the API service started within 5 minutes. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f3000276]** This image shows an automated evaluation summary, likely from the TDS course, providing feedback to a student on their project submission. It displays the student's Github and Docker repository URLs, followed by pre-requisite checks which all pass (Docker and Github repos exist, LICENSE file, and Dockerfile exist). The image presents a score breakdown with task score 0, bonus 1, and P1 score 1, while also showing assessment results as zero for various components labeled A1-A10, B1-B10, and C1-C5. Lastly, it contains a note explaining that both Docker and evaluation logs are attached for students passing prerequisites, but an evaluation log will only be available if the API service started working within 5 minutes, otherwise only a Docker log will be present, also noting that the `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` files are shared for learning and issue diagnosis. 2x" data-dominant-color="29282F">WhatsApp Image 2025-04-07 at 15.39.10_edb0b829720×1600 125 KB
