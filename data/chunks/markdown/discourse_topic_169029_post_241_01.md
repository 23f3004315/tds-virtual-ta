**[Discussion Image by 22f3000370]** This image shows content from a TDS student discussion thread about "Project 2 - TDS Solver." The post displays a list of numerical values, representing some kind of financial calculation, possibly complaint values. It proceeds to calculate a sum from the values with a title "Summing these values," and adds the numbers, 1,233.00 + 56,767.00 + 2,400.00 + 1,234.00 + 10,000.00 + 20.00 + 2,000.00 + 2,003,030.00 + 5,000.00, arriving at a total of 2,073,684.00, which is declared as the "**total value of complaints**". This appears to be a correct calculation of the total complaints, and likely represents an instructor or peer providing a sample calculation to aid understanding.ual values (including negative values) related to complaints, followed by the calculation of the total. The calculation shows the student summing up a series of numbers, including "5,000.00 (total of subsequent similar entries)," and arriving at a final sum of 2,073,684.00, which is then stated as the total value of complaints. The image implies the student is demonstrating or explaining how they've computed the total value based on the provided complaint amounts." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="ahEr5tg9MxlSXPFTfrcizxcAoe8" width="558" height="500" data-dominant-color="A48BE5">image643Ã—576 36.1 KB
