**[Discussion Image by 23f2000599]** This image is a screenshot of a course instructor's message regarding project evaluation feedback, specifically addressing discrepancies. The instructor informs students that "MISSING" files will result in a score of 0 and emphasizes that Docker images must become responsive within 5 minutes of launch to be considered. The message details which files were missing in the evaluation (such as the Evaluation log file), providing a link to the Docker log file, and explaining the purpose of several attachment files including server start logs, evaluation script files, data generation file, Docker orchestration file, and solution script. The docker image ID evaluated is provided (e1f186d9ce91) as additional context. The instructor also assures that performance issues were not due to server or network bottlenecks and that students may contact them if they believe there to be an error. evaluation log file containing performance reports, 2) a Docker log file (available via a provided Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zn-ajY5yB1M1xxhraquPcPFNvqe7-ebC/view?usp=drivesdk) detailing technical performance, 3) Server start log files (arm vs x86) as an attachment to troubleshoot service startup, 4) evaluation script files (arm vs x86) attachment showing scoring mechanism, 5) data generation file attachment needed for the evaluation, 6) Docker orchestration file attachment handling image retrieval and environment variables and 7) A solution script (zip attachment) demonstrates project completion via prompt engineering as an example. The final line provides the Docker image ID evaluated: e1f186d9ce91. The student needs to locate or regenerate the missing 'Evaluation log file' and potentially review the attached files to diagnose any issues with their submission." alt="1000472083" data-base62-sha1="qT39rwpei3ylAuEBaKKlto3y2w4" width="225" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2000599]** This image shows instructor feedback on a student's Project 1 submission, indicating potential problems with the Docker image configuration or execution. The message alerts the student that the evaluation either didn't run or the Docker image was misconfigured, and they can contact the course staff if they believe it's an error. The feedback also emphasizes that missing files will result in a score of 0 and that the Docker image should become responsive within 5 minutes, running on an 8-core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit with high-speed network bandwidth. Finally, the instructor lists seven crucial files generated during the evaluation process, including log files, script files, and orchestration files and provides the student Docker image ID., **[Discussion Image by 23f2000599]** This image captures an instructor's message on the TDS student discussion board, addressing potential project evaluation issues. It outlines that evaluations might fail if the Docker image is misconfigured, and missing files result in a zero score. The message states that the Docker image should be responsive within 5 minutes on an 8-core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit with 1 Gigabit of network bandwidth. It then lists seven key files provided to students including the Evaluation log file (often missing), Docker log file (with a provided Google Drive link), Server start log file, Evaluation script file, Data generation file, Docker orchestration file, and Solution script, indicating their purpose in the project evaluation process and some attached as zip files. Finally, the message reveals the ID of the evaluated Docker image, e1f186d9ce91, allowing students to potentially cross-reference with their submissions. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2000599]** This image shows instructor feedback regarding a student's Project 1 submission, indicating that the evaluation either failed or the Docker image was misconfigured. The feedback highlights that missing files result in a score of 0 and the Docker image must become responsive within 5 minutes of launch to be considered. The evaluation ran on an 8-core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit with 1 Gigabit of dedicated network bandwidth, eliminating server performance as a bottleneck. It also itemizes seven key files or logs for the student to review: the missing evaluation log file, a Docker log file available via a Google Drive link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zn-ajY5yB1M1xxhraquPcPFNvqe7-ebC/view?usp=drivesdk), the server start log file, the evaluation script file, the data generation file, the Docker orchestration file, and a solution script, all of which, except the Docker log, are attached. Finally, the instructor provides the Docker image ID that was evaluated (e1f186d9ce91). 2x" data-dominant-color="2D2E33">10004720831080×2400 255 KB
