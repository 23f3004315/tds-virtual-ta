**[Discussion Image by roy2003]** This image captures a student's attempt to provide an ngrok URL within a deployment tool interface, likely during an assignment involving Llamafile and ngrok, as part of a TDS discussion on deployment tools. The student is prompted to enter the ngrok URL and provides `https://328e-43-251-171-164.ngrok-free.app/`. However, the system flags this entry with an error: "Error: Response is not valid JSON: error code: 524," indicating a problem in the communication between the tool and the provided ngrok URL, possibly due to a timeout or the server not returning the expected JSON format. The UI elements "Check" and "Save" are visible at the bottom of the image. The presence of an error message suggests the student is encountering a problem and potentially seeking help in understanding or resolving the JSON response issue. providing the ngrok URL. The student has entered `https://328e-43-251-171-164.ngrok-free.app/` as the ngrok URL, but the UI displays an error message: "Error: Response is not valid JSON: error code: 524". This suggests a problem with the ngrok tunnel setup or the provided URL, potentially related to a server timeout or invalid response from the ngrok endpoint, preventing successful configuration. The presence of "Check" and "Save" buttons indicates an interactive configuration process." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-25 191736" data-base62-sha1="e94eNgHCwnU6KC1CD7zWwMsadMV" width="690" height="174" data-dominant-color="25292D">Screenshot 2025-01-25 1917361362Ã—345 11.5 KB
