**[Discussion Image by lakshaygarg654]** This image shows a snippet of data, likely part of a larger dataset used in the TDS Solver project discussion. The data contains transactional information, including `TransactionID`, `Customer Name`, `Country`, `Date`, `Product/Code`, `Sales`, and `Cost`. The Sales and Cost columns are both represented in USD currency. The Country column uses a mix of full names and abbreviations. The image serves as shared context for students discussing data handling, transformation, or other data-related issues within the project.ionID", "Customer Name", "Country", "Date", "Product/Code", "Sales", and "Cost". There are 14 records, with diverse customer data, date formats, and country names/codes (e.g., France/FRA/FR). The sales and cost values are listed with a USD currency denotation. This data is likely being used as a test case, or for analysis in the TDS Solver project, and is the subject of discussion amongst students. No particular question, answer, or error is highlighted, it is just the data under discussion." alt="mydata" data-base62-sha1="qYetz4niRz4sSTi8LqLpF7X9Gs3" width="517" height="220" data-dominant-color="E9E9EA">mydata939×401 18.3 KB
