**[Discussion Image by 22f3000657]** This image captures a student's attempt to use the FastAPI endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` to filter students by class, based on the instructions stating that the endpoint should accept a query parameter 'class'. The instructions specify expected behavior, providing examples like `/api?class=1A` and `/api?class=1A&class=1B`. The student encountered an error where the response from the API, containing a list of student IDs and classes, did not match the expected data; the error message "does not match expected" indicates the mismatch in the expected student records versus the actual student records. The instructions include a reminder to enable CORS. The final line indicates a check will be performed by sending a request to the URL with `?class=...` and comparing the response with the correct data.another, different list of student IDs and classes. The last line suggests further testing with a query parameter such as `?class=...` to validate the API's filtering logic against the correct data. CORS is also mentioned as a pre-requisite." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="nJD3lMthElOxdjKTxcxCIQDnC2i" width="690" height="243" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f3000657]** This image captures a student's attempt to use the FastAPI endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` to retrieve student data, including troubleshooting an error. The preceding text explains that the API should filter students based on the `class` query parameter (e.g., `/api?class=1A`). It also mentions CORS configuration and emphasizes that the API should return students in the same order as they appear in the CSV file. The error message indicates that the API response is not matching the expected student data. The student is then instructed to test the API using a `?class=` query and verify the returned data to debug the mismatches., **[Discussion Image by 22f3000657]** This image captures a student grappling with the FastAPI deployment tools assignment, specifically the query parameter filtering requirement for the `/api` endpoint based on class. The instructions outline how to construct URLs with the `class` query parameter (e.g., `/api?class=1A&class=1B`) to filter students, and emphasize the importance of CORS for GET requests and maintaining the original CSV order. The student identifies the FastAPI endpoint as `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`, but encounters an "Error: Response does not match expected" message, which displays the actual JSON response containing student data alongside the expected JSON response. The error suggests the API is not correctly filtering students based on the query parameters and/or the student is not formulating the `?class=` query correctly, prompting a strategy to test the URL with a `?class=` parameter and verify the returned data. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f3000657]** This image captures a student question within the "GA2 - Deployment Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]" regarding the implementation of a FastAPI endpoint. The student is asking about how to filter students by class using query parameters, providing examples like `/api?class=1A` and `/api?class=1A&class=1B`. The image includes a reminder to enable CORS and suggests the API endpoint might look like `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. Following the attempted API call to that endpoint, there is an error message indicating that the actual response received does not match the expected response, specifically showing a mismatch in the JSON data containing studentId and class information. The thread indicates the instructor will check the API by adding a query parameter for class and verify if the response data is what they expect. 2x" data-dominant-color="302E32">image1630Ã—575 64 KB
