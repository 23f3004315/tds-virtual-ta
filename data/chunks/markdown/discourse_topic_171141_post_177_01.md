Hi Course Team,

I have also received an email today saying that my Project1 failed. But few days back I received an email with evaluation log saying I got 8/20. Which one is true?

The email outlines the prerequisites which include having a public GitHub repository with a MIT license, a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image that runs via a specific podman command, and ensuring the Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository. The student's results show that the Docker image is present in Docker Hub and is public (PASS), the Github repo is present and public (PASS), but the Dockerfile is NOT present in the root of the github repo (FAIL), and the MIT license is present in the root of the Github repo (PASS). Because of the failed Dockerfile check, the student's prerequisites are marked as FAIL, and their Project 1 score is 0. This illustrates instructor feedback on initial project setup and areas for improvement related to Dockerfile placement within the GitHub repository. docker image. This indicates the message is flagging the missing Dockerfile and advising the student to ensure it is located in the root directory of their GitHub repository for the project to pass." alt="1000112508" data-base62-sha1="9VsjXkzgu3WEc9ewu0oPFV54Buk" width="314" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23ds2000092]** This image shows an email from the TDS Team to a student regarding their Project 1 prerequisites. The email details the requirements for passing the pre-requisite checks, including having a public GitHub repository with a LICENSE file, a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image that runs via podman, and ensuring the Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository. The email then presents the student's prerequisite evaluation: Docker image present and public (PASS), Github repo present and public (PASS), Dockerfile present in the root of the github repo (FAIL), and MIT license present in the root of the github repo (PASS). Ultimately, the student's project 1 score is a 0 because the "Dockerfile" was not detected in the root directory., **[Discussion Image by 23ds2000092]** This image shows an email from the TDS Team to a student regarding their Project 1 scores. The email outlines the prerequisites for Project 1, including having a publicly accessible GitHub repository with a LICENSE file and a valid Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image. It then provides the student's evaluation, indicating that while their Docker image and GitHub repo passed the checks, the "Dockerfile present in root of github repo" check failed. Consequently, the student's "Prerequisites" are marked as FAIL, and their Project 1 Score is 0. This suggests the student needs to ensure their Dockerfile is correctly placed in the root of their GitHub repository to pass the prerequisite checks. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23ds2000092]** This image depicts an automated email from the TDS Team providing feedback on Project 1 prerequisite evaluations. The email details five requirements for Project 1, including having a public GitHub repository with a LICENSE file, a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image that runs with a specific `podman` command (`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`), and that the Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository. The email shows that the student's Docker image and GitHub repo are present and public, and the MIT license is present, but the Dockerfile is not found in the root of the GitHub repository, causing the project prerequisites to fail and the project score to be 0. The student can use this email to troubleshoot the placement of their Dockerfile within their Github repository. 2x" data-dominant-color="E6E8ED">10001125081080Ã—1716 242 KB
