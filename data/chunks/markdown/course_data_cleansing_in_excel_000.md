## Data Cleansing in Excel

[**[Course Image: Clean up data in Excel]** This image illustrates a typical scenario in data cleansing within Excel, focusing on a dataset of city populations. It shows an Excel spreadsheet with columns like 'City,' 'Country,' 'UN 2018 population estimates,' 'City Definition,' 'City Population,' 'City Area (km2),' and 'City Density (/km2)'. The image highlights the structure of the data that often requires cleaning, which is a vital step before analysis, and provides examples of how the data is organized with different units (e.g., population estimates, area in km2, density). Students can master the basics of how to view and interpret raw data in excel and prepare for the following data cleansing techniques covered in the course. By viewing this data, students can see the need to format all the columns and clean the data before using it.ataset related to city populations and related metrics, demonstrating how to organize data before cleaning. The columns include city names, countries, UN 2018 population estimates, city definitions, city-proper population, area (in kmÂ²), and population density. Notice the variations in formatting and data types across columns which highlights common issues addressed during data cleansing. An example is the 'N/A' in the population and area columns for Lagos, indicating missing data that needs handling. This data structure serves as a starting point for applying various data cleansing techniques within Excel.)](https://youtu.be/7du7xkqeu4s)
