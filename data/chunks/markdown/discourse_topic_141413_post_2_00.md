I completely understand and share the concerns about the time constraints of the TDS exam. Given the challenging nature of the test, it seems quite difficult to complete all the questions within the allotted 45 minutes.

I believe even the course team would find it challenging to solve this exam in such a short time frame.

Perhaps considering a percentile-based grading system could be a fairer approach, as it would better reflect the relative performance of all students.

This way, we can ensure that the grading is equitable and does not unfairly impact our CGPAs. I hope the team can consider this suggestion.
