## Narratives with Excel

[**[Course Image: Narratives with Excel]** This Excel sheet demonstrates how to combine data, analysis, and narrative to communicate insights about COVID-19 cases. The sheet is organized into sections including "Data Structure", which includes time-series data of COVID-19 cases by month, and "Analysis Metrics", which calculates values like the slope of a trendline. A "Calibration" section translates numerical changes into qualitative descriptions like "totally collapsing" or "de-growing", providing a narrative context to the raw data. The sheet also incorporates a chart visually representing the "New Covid Cases", enhancing the storytelling aspect of the analysis.ting narratives with data, using COVID-19 case data as an example. It involves organizing data (date, value, location), calculating analysis metrics like slope, and calibrating interpretations based on value ranges (e.g., defining what constitutes "collapsing," "growing," or "de-growing"). The sheet also includes a column chart visualizing new COVID cases over time and trendline, and calculates the regression equation and R-squared value. These elements are combined to allow for crafting data-driven stories or insights.)](https://youtu.be/CRNJerr3pI4)
