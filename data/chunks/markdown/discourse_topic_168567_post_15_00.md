I created a discord

**[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image displays the Discord logo, indicating a shift in the student's discussion from the TDS platform to a Discord server environment for creating question-solving groups focused on Return on Equity (ROE). This suggests a peer discussion is taking place, where students are using Discord to coordinate, share resources, and potentially troubleshoot problems related to ROE calculations and interpretations. No error messages, code snippets or technical content is visible. The students are using Discord as a platform for collaborative learning outside of the main TDS course environment.n the Discord platform. The presence of the logo suggests that students are using Discord's features, such as text channels or voice channels, to collaborate and solve problems related to ROE (likely referring to Return on Equity or a similar financial metric). As a RAG training example, future students looking for help might find the Discord server or channel useful for asking questions and collaborating with peers. The platform likely facilitates real-time communication and code sharing for problem-solving. There is no specific technical content, error message, or solution visible in the image itself, only the identification of the communication platform being used." class="site-icon" data-dominant-color="8891F6" width="256" height="256">
