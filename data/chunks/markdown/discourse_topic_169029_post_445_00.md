@Saransh_Saini @carlton sir today I received this email

**[Discussion Image by 23f3001764]** This image shows an announcement from the course instructors in the "Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread" on TDS. It informs students that server endpoint checks for Project 2 are still in progress and asks them to turn back on any components they may have turned off after being told evaluations were complete. The announcement acknowledges the inconvenience and the use of cloud credits, assuring students that they will be notified when the evaluation is complete to avoid unnecessary resource consumption. This communication addresses concerns about running costs and provides clear instructions for students regarding the status of their project evaluations. The message emphasizes the importance of not ignoring this announcement, indicating potential impact on project grading and resource management.meta">image1408Ã—305 10.9 KB

I have did not turned it off it is just that the first request take time of 50 to 60 sec as you can see in the image.
