**[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image depicts a student's attempt to access a TDS solver API documentation using Postman, revealing a configuration with Swagger UI. The Postman interface shows a GET request to `http://localhost:8000/api` with a linked address `shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs`, and the response body displays HTML content configuring Swagger UI via JavaScript. The HTML includes a script tag referencing a Swagger UI bundle from a CDN and initializes SwaggerUIBundle with a URL pointing to `/openapi.json`, indicating the API documentation is intended to be rendered in the "swagger-ui" div. The successful status code "200 OK" suggests the API endpoint is accessible, and the size of the response is 1.11 KB; the issue if any, may relate to how the Swagger UI is rendered or configured within the application. The overall context suggests the student may be trying to access and understand the API documentation using Swagger UI and Postman.rectly because the student is accessing the API endpoint instead of the Swagger UI endpoint. The image suggests the student is likely in the process of configuring or testing their API documentation using Swagger." alt="get" data-base62-sha1="swUI2YjkM4AXcq3PHxUZM7Ginwp" width="690" height="466" srcset="**[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image captures a student's interaction with Postman, a tool used for API testing, likely during the TDS Solver project. The student has sent a GET request to `http://localhost:8000/api` and is viewing the HTML response in the "Body" section, specifically in "Pretty" view. The HTML response includes HTML to load and initialize Swagger UI. Swagger UI is a user interface to visually interact with an API based on its OpenAPI specification, and the code snippet shows the Swagger UI bundle being loaded from a CDN and initialized with the `openapi.json` file. The request returns a 200 OK status, indicating success and showing the size and time., **[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image depicts a student's interaction with Postman while working on the TDS Solver Project 2. The student is attempting to access the API documentation, specifically the Swagger UI, at both `http://localhost:8000/api` and the cloud-hosted endpoint `shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs`. The Postman response shows a 200 OK status, and the HTML body displays the Swagger UI initialization code, which includes the HTML structure (``) and a script tag loading the Swagger UI bundle from a CDN. The JavaScript code initializes the SwaggerUIBundle with configurations, including the URL for the OpenAPI specification (`/openapi.json`) and the DOM ID for the UI (`#swagger-ui`). This suggests the student is successfully retrieving the Swagger UI but might be encountering issues with the display or functionality, which they are likely troubleshooting within the context of the discussion thread. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image depicts a Postman request and response related to accessing the Swagger UI documentation for a TDS Solver project, likely related to Project 2 in a course. The student is using Postman to send a GET request to "http://localhost:8000/api" and to "shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs". The response body is HTML code which includes the Swagger UI, which indicates the API documentation is being served correctly. The Swagger UI is initialized using the 'SwaggerUIBundle' Javascript object, configured to fetch the OpenAPI specification from '/openapi.json' and render it in the div with the ID 'swagger-ui'. The request returns a 200 OK status, confirming the resource is accessible. The status bar also displays the request time as 247ms and the size of the response as 1.11KB. No specific error messages or confusion points are evident from this screenshot, which likely provides a successful scenario of a student accessing the Swagger UI. 2x" data-dominant-color="212222">get1525Ã—1030 38.6 KB
