## Post #49 by 23f2001286

Since the token is limited, I have thought to use the run llms locally, to check for the accuracy of solving the question.

I want to know which LLM will be more closer to the one used for evaluating our project.
Does the model used for evaluation is capable for handling raw files, or we need to pass it in the text format..(As as I am to recall, the models are capable enough to handle the files..)

Thanks!

Does anyone willing to work with me..?
