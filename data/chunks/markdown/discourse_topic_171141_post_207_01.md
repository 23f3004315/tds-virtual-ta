**[Discussion Image by 23f3003463]** This screenshot from the TDS "Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies" discussion displays automated feedback on a student's Project 1 submission. The feedback indicates that "submission will not get evaluated" and presents the project's prerequisite evaluations. The evaluations show a "FAIL" for "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo," even though the Docker image and GitHub repo are present and public, and the MIT license is present. Consequently, the overall "Prerequisites" status is "FAIL," resulting in a "Project 1 Score: 0," indicating a likely area of student confusion regarding file placement within the GitHub repository. The message is signed "Kind regards, TDS Team."using the automated check to fail. The TDS team's message acts as feedback to the student, pinpointing the exact reason for the prerequisite failure. The student needs to ensure a file named "Dockerfile" exists at the top level of their Github repository." alt="pro 1" data-base62-sha1="1X2YuVK73sp5O87IjN3SvRjvvkY" width="225" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f3003463]** This image shows a feedback message from the TDS team regarding Project 1 prerequisite evaluations, indicating that the submission will not be evaluated because the prerequisites have failed. Specifically, the evaluation shows that the Docker image is present and public in Dockerhub, the Github repo is present and public, and the MIT license is present in the root of the github repo. However, the check for "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo" resulted in a FAIL status, causing the overall "Prerequisites" to be marked as FAIL and the "Project 1 Score" to be 0. This suggests the student needs to ensure a Dockerfile exists in the root directory of their GitHub repository for Project 1., **[Discussion Image by 23f3003463]** This image shows an automated email response received by a student after submitting Project 1. The email provides prerequisite evaluation results, indicating whether the submission met certain requirements. The Docker image and Github repo are confirmed to be present and public (PASS), as is the MIT license. However, the "Dockerfile" is missing from the root of the Github repository (FAIL), resulting in an overall "Prerequisites: FAIL" status and a Project 1 score of 0, meaning the submission will not be evaluated further. The email serves as feedback, informing the student that the missing Dockerfile needs to be added to the root directory of their Github repository for the submission to pass the prerequisites. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f3003463]** This image shows an automated email from the TDS team that evaluates the student's Project 1 prerequisites. The email indicates that the project submission will not be evaluated due to failed prerequisites. Specifically, the Docker image and GitHub repository are present and public (PASS), but the Dockerfile is not found in the root of the GitHub repository (FAIL), while the MIT license is present (PASS). Because of the missing Dockerfile, the overall prerequisites are marked as FAIL, resulting in a Project 1 score of 0. 2x" data-dominant-color="302622">pro 1720Ã—1600 81.5 KB
