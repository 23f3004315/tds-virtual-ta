 wouldn’t need to answer similar doubts again. Sorry if some of the doubts are basic / written incorrectly.

FILES
The data file sent to the api will always be in the **requester’s** local machine. When the api server receives the request, the file will be in binary format?

Or

---

Sometimes the api server receives the file in byte and some times, it will recieve a link like this : **[Discussion Image by 23f2000573]** The image represents a visual output or a test case being discussed in the TDS Solver project discussion thread. It displays a black background with four colored shapes: a red square, a green circle, a yellow triangle, and a blue horizontal line. The red square and green circle are positioned at the top, with the square to the left of the circle. The blue line runs horizontally across the center of the image, and the yellow triangle is placed below the blue line towards the bottom. This setup likely serves as a validation point for the solver's ability to detect and differentiate various geometric shapes. The shapes' positions and colors would need to be correctly identified by the solver.

This link was take from GA2 Question 2

HTML AND TABLE
Some questions have `html` and `tables`. In this case will these two be in a file encoded in binary, or will it be a string.

Example for string. Consider the table

Col 1
Col 2

Row 1, Col1
Row 1 Col 2

Row 2, Col 1
Row 2 Col 2

Will this be something like this
