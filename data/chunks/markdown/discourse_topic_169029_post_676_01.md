**[Discussion Image by 23f1002643]** This image shows a Google Form related to Project 2 of the TDS course, specifically for updating URL endpoints. The form informs students that their email address (23f1002643@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) has been recorded and instructs them to provide an updated endpoint, emphasizing that they should edit their existing submission rather than submitting multiple forms. The form includes a field for the endpoint, with the default value or example pre-filled as "tds-ga-llm.vercel.app/api". It cautions against submitting multiple forms, suggesting a potential issue with duplicate entries. The discussion likely revolves around managing and updating API endpoints for the TDS solver project. 23f1002643]** This image shows a Google Form related to the TDS solver project, specifically for updating URL endpoints. The form begins with a message explaining that it is designed to streamline URL endpoint changes and accommodate grievances, enabling students to update their endpoints. It confirms the student's email (23f1002643@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) was recorded upon submission and requests the student to provide an updated endpoint. The form emphasizes that if the endpoint changes, students should edit their previously submitted form to ensure the latest endpoint is available and warns against submitting multiple forms, which will likely be ignored. Finally, the current default URL endpoint being requested is "tds-ga-llm.vercel.app/api"., **[Discussion Image by 23f1002643]** This image depicts a Google Form presented to a student (23f1002643@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) for updating their project endpoint for the TDS Solver project. The form explicitly instructs the student to edit their previously submitted entry if the endpoint changes and strongly advises against submitting multiple forms. The displayed endpoint is "tds-ga-llm.vercel.app/api." The form description indicates that this process streamlines endpoint updates to accommodate student grievances related to URL changes. Therefore, this is a communication from the course instructors to the student regarding how to manage updates to the project endpoint. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1002643]** This image captures a Google Form interface within the TDS project discussion, specifically related to updating the student's deployed endpoint. It shows a form notification indicating that "Your email (23f1002643@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) was recorded when you submitted this form". The form requests the student to provide their updated endpoint, with the instruction: "If the endpoint changes, please edit this form that you have already submitted so that we can have the latest endpoint. Do not submit multiple forms." The student's current endpoint is displayed as tds-ga-llm.vercel.app/api. It is clear this is part of an automated process set up by the instructors to handle endpoint changes in a streamlined way, and the student is following instructions to update their endpoint via the form. 2x" data-dominant-color="232327">Screenshot_2025-04-17-13-16-34-275_com.google.android.gm1080Ã—2340 230 KB
