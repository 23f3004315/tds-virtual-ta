**[Discussion Image by 23f2001188]** This image depicts a student attempting to answer a question about file sizes and modification dates as part of the "GA1 - Development Tools" discussion. The student is instructed to download "q-list-files-attributes.zip," extract it, and use the `ls` command with appropriate options to list file details. The question asks for the total size of files at least 2404 bytes in size and modified on or after March 18, 2002, 1:02 am IST. The student's initial answer, "485969," is marked as incorrect, and the instructor advises against using Windows Explorer to unzip, as it can alter timestamps, recommending `unzip` or `7-Zip` instead to preserve the correct file modification times for accurate calculation.ents, and using the `ls` command with appropriate options to list file details, including date and size. The student is prompted to calculate the total size of all files in the extracted archive that are at least 2404 bytes in size and were modified on or after Monday, March 18, 2002, at 1:02 AM IST. The student's initial answer of "485969" is marked as incorrect. The instruction provides a critical hint: avoid copying files directly from within the ZIP archive or using Windows Explorer to unzip, as this can corrupt the file timestamps; instead, extract using command line tools like `unzip` or utilities like 7-Zip to preserve timestamps for accurate size calculation." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="qI1CDV7rmTrTyrWSxJ7Htillycb" width="690" height="283" data-dominant-color="2B2F33">image846Ã—347 28.4 KB
