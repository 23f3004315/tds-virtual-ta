The user, 23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in, is viewing workflow run #13 and has navigated to the "Workflow file" section to view the YAML configuration. The YAML file sets up a workflow named after the student's email address, scheduled to run daily at 10:00 AM UTC using a cron job, and allows manual triggering via `workflow_dispatch`. The workflow has a `daily-commit` job, running on `ubuntu-latest`, which includes steps like checking out code using `actions/checkout@v3` and configuring Git. The student likely posted this as a reference point while discussing the workflow's setup and potential issues in the discussion thread., **[Discussion Image by 23f2003853]** This image captures a student's Github workflow file as part of a TDS Jan 2025 "GA4 - Data Sourcing" discussion. The student, 23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in, is viewing the workflow file (.github/workflows/daily-commit.yml) for a specific run, accessible via a Github URL. The YAML file shows the workflow's configuration, including its name, scheduling (cron: '0 10 * * *' for daily runs at 10:00 AM UTC), permissions (contents: write), the job definition "daily-commit", and steps such as checking out code using actions/checkout@v3. The workflow is configured to run on ubuntu-latest and includes steps to configure Git. The interface displays options to "Re-run all jobs" indicating a possible troubleshooting or debugging context, and navigation links to "Summary", "Jobs", "Run details", "Usage", and the currently selected "Workflow file" within the run. The image shows that the student is likely exploring the configuration of their Github Actions workflow. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2003853]** This image depicts a student's GitHub workflow configuration file within the TDS "GA4 - Data Sourcing" discussion.
