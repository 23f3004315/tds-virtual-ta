Hi Team, I have appeared for ROE TDS 2025 and have secured 3 marks, but my score is shown as zero in the dashboard.

Please clarify.

" link to navigate to the course details." data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/6bn8hIaFe1wla4ixrnmi72Lu7pt.png?dl=1" title="image" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">**[Discussion Image by 23f1002510]** This image depicts a student's view of their "My Current Courses" dashboard, showcasing their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) as 7.8 and Project CGPA as 0.0 for the term. Two courses are listed: "Business Data Management" marked as "REPEAT FULL COURSE" with scores for Week 1 and Week 2 assignments, and "Tools in Data Science" marked as "NEW COURSE" with scores for Week 1 to Week 5 assignments, and a "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - Absent" status. The student is likely seeking clarification regarding the "Absent" label on the programming quiz and whether it reflects a submission issue or incorrect grading in the "Tools in Data Science" course. Each course listing contains a "Go to Course page >" button for navigation to further details or assignment submissions. This is from a student discussion where they are seeking clarification about their score on a quiz.(CGPA) is 7.8, and the Project CGPA is 0.0. Two courses are listed: "Business Data Management," which is marked as "REPEAT FULL COURSE," and "Tools in Data Science," labeled as "NEW COURSE." For "Tools in Data Science," individual assignment scores are listed (e.g., Week 1 Assignment - 35.00), and "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1" is marked as "Absent," indicating a missing grade. Both course modules have a "Go to Course page >" link, likely used to navigate to the specific course details. This suggests the student is inquiring about the "Absent" status for Programming Quiz 1 in the discussion thread." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="6bn8hIaFe1wla4ixrnmi72Lu7pt" width="690" height="433" data-dominant-color="BCACAC">image930Ã—584 42.8 KB
