 file has 258,074 rows. Each row is an Apache web log entry for the site s-anand.net in May 2024. Each row has these fields:

IP: The IP address of the visitor.

Remote logname: The remote logname of the visitor. Typically ‘-’.

---

Remote user: The remote user of the visitor. Typically ‘-’.

Time: The time of the visit. E.g. [01/May/2024:00:00:00 +0000]. Note that this is not quoted, and you need to handle this.

Request: The request made by the visitor. E.g. GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1. It has three space-separated parts:

(a) Method: The HTTP method. E.g. GET.

(b) URL: The URL visited. E.g. /blog/.

(c) Protocol: The HTTP protocol. E.g. HTTP/1.1.

Status: The HTTP status code. If 200 &lt;= Status &lt; 300, it is a successful request.

Size: The size of the response in bytes. E.g. 1234.

Referer: The referer URL. E.g. https://s-anand.net/.

User agent: The browser used. This will contain spaces and might have escaped quotes.

Vhost: The virtual host. E.g. s-anand.net.

Server: The IP address of the server.

The fields are separated by spaces and quoted by double quotes (‘-’). Unlike CSV files, quoted fields are escaped via \" and not ‘-’. (This impacts 41 rows.)

All data is in the GMT-0500 timezone, and the questions are based on this same timezone.
