Did Not Receive Project 1 Score â€“ Need Clarification

**Post Content:**

[Quote]: 
**Hello, sir** @carlton @Jivraj

I received the evaluation email for my **Project 1 Docker Image** submission, but unlike my friend (who got an email with his score), my email did **not** include my score.

My Docker image ID: **6f446c9b84da**

The email I received only contains logs and attachments, but no information about my actual score. in the mail recieved by my friend the score is clearly mentioned,

I would really appreciate it if you could **clarify my project score** and let me know if it was properly evaluated. If there is any issue, I request a reconsideration of my project evaluation.

Thank you for your help!

**Attachments:**
