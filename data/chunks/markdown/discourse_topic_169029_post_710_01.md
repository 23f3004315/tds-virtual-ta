 afternoon, it is showing GA 2 question 2 has failed but my answer is a hardcoded url (“https://23f2004837.github.io/”) from the code. This url is accessible and again tested of the GA platform for the same question and it is working as expected

Code:

**[Discussion Image by 23f2004837]** This image shows the Q23.py file from the TDS-Hackers/GASolver GitHub repository, likely part of a student project. The code imports `os` and `json`, and defines an `execute` function that takes a question (string) and a parameter. Inside `execute`, there's a hardcoded `cache` dictionary mapping student email addresses (e.g., "23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in") to GitHub Pages URLs. If the email provided in the `parameter` dictionary is not found as a key in the `cache`, the function returns the string "Enter the value in url_cache", otherwise, it attempts to return the associated cached URL. The file is being viewed by the user `23f2004837`.tfolio URLs based on student emails. The student's username is shown as 23f2004837, corresponding to the filename Q23.py, suggesting this is their solution for question 23." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="vuk7SswpGP8bT6035IiNsCVY5e8" width="663" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2004837]** This image shows a code snippet of `Q23.py` file within the `GA2` folder of the `GASolver` project on GitHub, specifically from the repository of `TDS-Hackers`. The code defines an `execute` function that takes a question and a parameter, accessing an email parameter. The code block sets up a `cache` dictionary that maps student email addresses to GitHub repository URLs. If the email is not present in the cache, the function returns "Enter the value in url_cache", otherwise, the URL corresponding to the provided email is returned. This is likely part of a larger project, possibly for a TDS course, where student GitHub profiles are linked to their email addresses for assessment or other purposes., **[Discussion Image by 23f2004837]** This image shows the code for `Q23.py` within the `GASolver` project on GitHub. The code imports `os` and `json` modules and defines an `execute` function that takes a question string and a parameter dictionary as input. Inside the function, there's a hardcoded cache that maps student email addresses to GitHub Pages URLs. If the email provided in the `parameter["email"]` is not found in the cache, the function returns a message prompting the user to "Enter the value in url_cache". Otherwise, it returns the GitHub Pages URL associated with the email from the `cache`. This code snippet seems to be part of a student's solution for Project 2, where they are attempting to fetch or provide Git portfolio information based on the student's email. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2004837]** This image depicts a code snippet from the `Q23.py` file within the `GA2` directory of the `GASolver` repository on GitHub, part of the TDS-Hackers organization, and shows the `execute` function designed to retrieve user portfolio URLs based on email. The function initializes a `cache` dictionary that maps student email addresses to their corresponding GitHub portfolio URLs and if the provided email is not in the `cache`, it returns a message prompting the user to "Enter the value in url_cache"; otherwise, it returns the URL associated with the email. This snippet is likely part of a TDS Solver project and highlights the use of a hardcoded dictionary as a simple caching mechanism. A student is likely working on Project 2 and examining this file to understand how portfolio URLs are resolved. 2x" data-dominant-color="F5F6F7">image1712×1290 285 KB
