hi @23f2003853

I think you are running your application server inside a virtual machine because of which it doesnâ€™t have visibility to outside world(request coming from other domains). So you would need to identify ipaddress of your virtual machine and would need to use that in place of `127.0.0.1`. Take help from GPT to identify ipaddress of virtual machine.
