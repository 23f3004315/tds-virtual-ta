**[Discussion Image by 22f3001315]** This image represents a student's post linking to a GitHub repository named "dolfacts" created by "gkmfrombs," and likely shows their deployment efforts or a question related to this project during the "GA2 - Deployment Tools - Discussion Thread." The GitHub repository has one contributor, zero issues, zero stars, and zero forks. The linked repository may be relevant to the ongoing discussion about deployment tools within the TDS Jan 2025 cohort. The student likely seeks advice or wants to share their progress with the mentioned project.stars, or forks. The repository icon is a pixelated design featuring green squares. This is shared in the discussion thread "GA2 - Deployment Tools" from the TDS Jan 2025 cohort, likely referencing an example or resource the student is sharing, though without further context it is unclear what aspect of deployment tools the student intends to highlight. The image is a static representation of the repository's current state on GitHub, without showing specific code or command-line interaction." class="thumbnail" data-dominant-color="F6F3F1">
