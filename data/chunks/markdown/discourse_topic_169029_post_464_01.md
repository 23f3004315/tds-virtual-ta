Hello sir

can you check and say if my server has been evaluated or not ?

My roll no : 23f3003871

My endpoint is working smoothly, I am showing it to you in this photo.

**[Discussion Image by 23f3003871]** This image shows a student posting their solution to Project 2 of the TDS course, specifically the part that involves using the TDS Solver. The student is using a Colab notebook and has defined the `url`, `files`, and `data` variables needed to interact with the "tds-project-2-ruby.vercel.app/api" endpoint, indicating the endpoint to the API. The `files` variable opens the 'q-unicode-data.zip' file in binary read mode. The `data` variable contains the question prompt that involves processing CSV and text files with different encodings (CP-1252, UTF-8, UTF-16), then summing the 'value' column where the 'symbol' column matches "OR" or "S". The student then uses `requests.post()` to send the data, prints the `response.status_code` (which is 200), and `response.text`, which returns the answer `{"answer":39961}`.ata-base62-sha1="qvvn7w1AUmNU4jO51mx0ChFotVG" width="666" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f3003871]** This image depicts a student's code in a Colab notebook for Project 2 of the TDS course, focusing on the TDS solver. The code sends a POST request to a specified URL, along with a zip file ('q-unicode-data.zip') containing data to be processed and a question describing the required data manipulation, which involves extracting data from three files with different encodings (CP-1252, UTF-8, UTF-16). The data files contain symbol-value pairs, and the task is to sum values where the symbol matches '' across all files. The code prints the response status code and the server's response text, which indicates a successful request (status code 200) and the calculated answer as 39961. The student is demonstrating their solution to the prompt by posting the code and result., **[Discussion Image by 23f3003871]** This image captures a student's Colab notebook showing their solution for a TDS project involving processing a zip file containing three differently encoded CSV/TXT files. The goal is to download "q-unicode-data.zip", extract the three files (data1.csv, data2.csv, data3.txt) encoded in CP-1252, UTF-8, and UTF-16 respectively, and sum the "value" column for rows where the "symbol" column matches specific characters. The code includes a URL for an API endpoint, opens the zip file, and prepares the 'data' dictionary with the problem description as 'question'. It then uses requests.post() to send the files and problem description to the API, and prints the status code and response text, which indicates a successful response (200) with the correct answer {"answer":39961}. This demonstrates a successful submission and correct answer to the TDS project question. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f3003871]** This image depicts a student submission in the TDS project 2 discussion, showcasing the code used to interact with the TDS solver API. The code includes setting the `url` to the API endpoint, preparing the `files` dictionary to send the 'q-unicode-data.zip' file, and formulating the `data` dictionary containing the problem description, detailing file encodings and summing instructions. The student uses `requests.post` to send the data and prints the `response.status_code` and `response.text`, with the output indicating a successful status code of 200 and the correct answer {"answer":39961}. This suggests the student correctly formatted the API request and received the expected response from the TDS solver. 2x" data-dominant-color="7E7D96">10000027021920Ã—1440 391 KB
