# Live Session: 04 Feb 2025

[**[Course Image: 2025-02-04 Week 4 - Session 1 - TDS Jan 25]** This image represents the start of Week 4, Session 1 in the TDS (likely The Data Science) course, specifically from the January 2025 offering and held on February 4th, 2025. This session will likely cover data-related topics, suggested by the visual elements of charts, graphs, and data flow diagrams. Expect to learn new concepts or tools related to data analysis, visualization, or manipulation during this session. This session builds upon the content covered in the previous three weeks, so ensure you're familiar with those materials. By the end of this session, you should be able to apply new data-related techniques to your TDS projects.de for "Week 4 - Session 1" of the TDS (presumably, the "TDS Jan 25" cohort) live sessions, scheduled for February 4, 2025. This session likely covers data analysis or a related topic, as indicated by the graphical elements surrounding the title, which include charts, diagrams, and data-related icons. The session will build on concepts introduced in previous weeks, specifically Weeks 1-3. The slide serves as an introduction to the content that will be covered in the "live-session-2025-02-04", setting the stage for students to engage with the week's learning objectives and practical applications.)](https://youtu.be/8A7Z_PN_PzQ)

**Q1: I'm having trouble with question 7 of the GA3 assignment. I'm trying to send a POST request, but it keeps showing "method not allowed".**

**A1:** When you access a URL from a browser, it sends a GET request. To send a POST request, you need an extension like Thunder Client or Postman. Thunder Client doesn't require a login, but Postman does. However, Thunder Client is now a paid service.

**Q2: Previously, I was seeing some things, but now I'm getting the "method not allowed" error. I don't know why.**

**A2:** Let's troubleshoot this. We'll use Thunder Client.

**Q3: After changing my method to POST, what do I do next?**
