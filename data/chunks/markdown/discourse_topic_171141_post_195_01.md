**[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image shows an email sent to a student (Dear Learner) regarding the TDS Project 1 prerequisite checks. The email details the requirements, including having a public GitHub repository with a LICENSE file and a valid Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image. Critically, the email also shows the results of the prerequisite evaluations, indicating that the Docker image is present and public (PASS), but the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license presence all failed (FAIL). The email concludes that the prerequisites have failed and the Project 1 score is 0, emphasizing the importance of meeting the minimum requirements for evaluation. The student likely posted this to the discussion to troubleshoot why their repo is not passing the automated checks.nse presence all fail. As a result, the student's prerequisites are marked as FAIL, and their initial Project 1 score is 0. The student needs to ensure their GitHub repository is public and contains a Dockerfile and MIT license file in the root directory." alt="1000105386" data-base62-sha1="iaQhsusUKxcxiJH2300WMPkeWv9" width="299" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image is an automated email providing a learner with feedback on Project 1 prerequisite checks. The email outlines five requirements, including having a publicly accessible GitHub repository with a LICENSE file (MIT license) and a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image that runs via a specified podman command, and ensuring the Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository. The email then shows a breakdown of the student's attempt, which indicates that while the Docker image is present and public, the GitHub repo, Dockerfile, and MIT license are not detected in the root of the GitHub repository, resulting in a failing prerequisite score and a project score of 0. The student needs to address the failed checks to get evaluated., **[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image shows an email response from the instructors outlining the prerequisites for Project 1 in a TDS course, along with an automated evaluation of the student's submission. The prerequisites include having a publicly accessible GitHub repository with a LICENSE file (MIT license) and a valid Dockerfile, as well as a publicly accessible Docker image that runs correctly using a specific `podman run` command. The evaluation reveals that the student's Docker image is present and public, but the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license are not detected, resulting in a failed prerequisite check and a project score of 0. The email serves as a notification of these failures, indicating that the submission will not be evaluated further unless the prerequisites are met, acting as instructor feedback to resolve initial issues. This allows the student to troubleshoot and resolve the Github repo, Dockerfile, and MIT license issues. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image depicts an email sent to a student detailing the prerequisite checks for Project 1. The email states that the project requires passing checks for a publicly accessible GitHub repository with a LICENSE file, a valid Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image runnable via podman with a specific command, "podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME". The email then shows the student's Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations, showing that the Docker image is present and public, but the GitHub repo, Dockerfile, and MIT license are failing the checks. The final lines state that the prerequisites are FAIL, and the Project 1 score is 0, indicating that the student will not be evaluated until the prerequisites are met. 2x" data-dominant-color="252A29">10001053861072Ã—1787 256 KB
