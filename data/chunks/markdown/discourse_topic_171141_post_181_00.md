**[Discussion Image by RASHID]** This image represents a Project 1 prerequisite evaluation report for a student. The report shows evaluations for four criteria: Docker image presence and public availability on Docker Hub (PASS), GitHub repository presence and public availability (PASS), presence of a Dockerfile in the root of the GitHub repository (FAIL), and presence of an MIT license at the root of the GitHub repository (PASS). The student is failing the requirement to have a Dockerfile in the root directory of their GitHub repository, which needs to be addressed. This feedback allows the student to correct the specific issue and resubmit their work to pass the prerequisite evaluation.ub AND is public," which passed. Also, "Is Github repo present AND public," which also passed. However, the evaluation "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo" failed, indicating that the Dockerfile was not found in the root directory of the student's GitHub repository. Finally, "Is MIT license present at root of github repo" passed, meaning the license was correctly placed." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="4ys581fZCiMPGysNGcdlklVUpf7" width="522" height="190">image522Ã—190 5.51 KB
