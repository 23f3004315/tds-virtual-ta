Good Afternoon Sir.

This is regarding project 1 and project 2.

**Project-1 Evaluation**

Sir, For the project 1, I have written the code, uploaded in GitHub and the dockerfile image is created and uploaded successfully.

Sir, I already contacted regarding Project - 1, you said to check it by replicating the test environment. I did till running the dockerfile but I needed evaluate.py sir, which I didnâ€™t get it. I got only 5 marks sir. Can you please check my code once sir and verify it as I have written the code and the dockerfile is running successfully.

**Project-2 Evaluation**

Regarding project 2 also, I have uploaded my code in GitHub and deployed my app in Vercel. But, I got 0 sir. Can you check my code once again and verify it? According to the guidance given, I deployed my app through Vercel. The app got deployed but I am getting 404 Error, even after trying any troubleshooting method. Maybe, Vercel is in development stage.
