**[Discussion Image by 21f3002277]** This image shows a JSON response, likely from the LLM-based automation agent in the TDS project discussion. The "message" field indicates that on 2025-02, the agent used "$2.0037491399999996", which exceeded the expected budget of "$2". This is likely part of a student discussion about debugging and managing the agent's resource consumption within the set limits. The long decimal number suggests a potential floating point precision issue causing a slight overspend. This indicates a need for the student to implement a rounding or truncation mechanism to ensure the agent strictly adheres to the budget.399999996", exceeding the set limit of "$2". The floating-point precision causes a slight overage, triggering the error message. A student likely posted this to seek help or understanding of the error in the context of their project. The discussion would likely focus on rounding/truncating the number to avoid such errors in future runs." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-15 140726" data-base62-sha1="c2l0wtftVs48bzpr1MlcrBfEhOB" width="690" height="71" data-dominant-color="F6F6F6">
