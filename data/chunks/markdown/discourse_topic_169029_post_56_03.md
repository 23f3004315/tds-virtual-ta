**[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image shows a quiz question posted within the TDS Solver project discussion. The first part prompts students to enter a specific formula into Google Sheets: `=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 6), 1, 10))`. Students are asked to determine the result of this formula. The second part instructs students to enter a formula into Excel: `=SUM(TAKE(SORTBY((3,14,6,10,3,12,9,6,3,12,15,4,11,11,4,14), (10,9,13,2,11,8,16,14,7,15,5,4,6,1,3,12)), 1, 9))`. It explicitly states that this Excel formula only works in Office 365, and a `#NAME?` error indicates an incompatible Excel version. Both problems have a "What is the result?" text field for the answer and a "Check" button to submit. the student gets a `#NAME?` error in Excel, it means they do not have the correct version of Excel (Office 365) needed to run the formula. Students are expected to input the results and click "Check" to submit their answer." alt="Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 5.43.34 PM" data-base62-sha1="gIn4NKjU0LEWXRej3jzaR6V190V" width="690" height="389" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image shows an exercise from the TDS solver project, specifically for practicing spreadsheet formulas. The first part instructs users to input the `=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 6), 1, 10))` formula in Google Sheets to calculate a result, and the second part asks the student to use excel with formula `=SUM(TAKE(SORTBY((3,14,6,10,3,12,9,6,3,12,15,4,11,11,4,14),(10,9,13,2,11,8,16,14,7,15,5,4,6,1,3,12)),1,9))`. The excel part of the exercise explicitly states this works only in Office 365 and provides a `#NAME?` error message as a troubleshooting indicator for incompatible Excel versions. The student is expected to input the result of each calculation, and click the "Check" button to verify their answer., **[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image depicts quiz questions designed to test a student's ability to write formulas in Google Sheets and Excel. The first question requires writing a formula in Google Sheets: `=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 6), 1, 10))`. The student is then prompted to provide the result and check their answer. The second question, worth 0.25 marks and for Excel users, requires writing a formula in Excel: `=SUM(TAKE(SORTBY({3,14,6,10,3,12,9,6,3,12,15,4,11,11,4,14},{10,9,13,2,11,8,16,14,7,15,5,4,6,1,3,12}),1,9))`. It explicitly states that this will only work in Office 365, and indicates that a "#NAME?" error signifies an incompatible Excel version. Similar to the first question, the student is asked to input the result and check. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image depicts an interactive exercise where students are prompted to enter the result of provided formulas in Google Sheets and Excel. The first question asks for the result of the Google Sheets formula "=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 6), 1, 10))". The second question asks to calculate the Excel formula "=SUM(TAKE(SORTBY({3,14,6,10,3,12,9,6,3,12,15,4,11,11,4,14}, {10,9,13,2,11,8,16,14,7,15,5,4,6,1,3,12}), 1, 9))" and notes that this will only work in Office 365. The exercise uses input boxes for the answers, accompanied by "Check" buttons. If using an older Excel version, it returns a #NAME? error, the exercise suggests finding a friend with a compatible Excel version, which is a humorous workaround. 2x" data-dominant-color="22262A">Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 5.43.34 PM1329Ã—750 44.4 KB
