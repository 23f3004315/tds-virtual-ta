## Database: SQLite

Relational databases are used to store data in a structured way. You'll often access databases created by others for analysis.

PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle, etc. are popular databases. But the most installed database is [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html). It's embedded into many devices and apps (e.g. your phone, browser, etc.). It's lightweight but very scalable and powerful.

Watch these introductory videos to understand SQLite and how it's used in Python (34 min):

[**[Course Image: SQLite Introduction - Beginners Guide to SQL and Databases (22 min)]** This educational content introduces SQLite, a lightweight, file-based database management system. These introductory videos are designed to help students understand SQLite and its basic usage in Python. The videos cover fundamental SQL concepts and demonstrate how to interact with databases programmatically. Expect to learn about creating databases, defining tables, inserting data, and querying information, providing a solid foundation for working with SQLite in TDS projects. The video shows both a database icon and an image representing documentation or coding, both of which will be crucial to understanding SQLite.o SQLite, a lightweight, file-based database system often used when a full-fledged database server isn't needed. The material will likely cover the basics of SQL syntax within the SQLite environment, including creating tables, inserting data, querying data, and updating entries. Students can expect to learn how to interact with SQLite databases through a command-line interface or a graphical tool, allowing them to manage data for smaller applications or projects. Knowledge of basic SQL concepts would be helpful before diving into this introduction. A key takeaway will be understanding how SQLite differs from other database management systems in its architecture and use cases.)](https://youtu.be/8Xyn8R9eKB8)
