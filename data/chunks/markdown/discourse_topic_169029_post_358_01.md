@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini I too faced the same issue, I received a bunch of hits from random ip addresses and it got shut down.

**[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image shows a console output from the TDS solver application indicating a series of HTTP requests received by the server, along with warnings about invalid HTTP requests. The logs consist of "INFO" and "WARNING" messages, displaying IP addresses and ports making "GET" or "POST" requests to various URLs, often resulting in "404 Not Found" errors, such as "/manage/account/login HTTP/1.1", "/admin/index.html HTTP/1.1", "/.env.bak HTTP/1.1", and "/hudson HTTP/1.1". Several lines show "Invalid HTTP request received", implying malformed requests from clients. Finally, the log indicates the server is shutting down, waiting for application shutdown, and confirming the application shutdown is complete, including the finished server process ID [1320]. The error and warning messages likely represent attempts to access resources that don't exist on the server, or poorly formed requests, during the TDS solver project execution.as being terminated. The logs do not appear to be directly related to a specific question or solution provided by the instructor, but rather provide a snapshot of HTTP traffic and server state." alt="Screenshot 2025-04-06 at 12.37.36 PM" data-base62-sha1="kWzIUGVWdwWk1WwU6zd0khwkOCA" width="591" height="499" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image shows a log output from the TDS solver application during the "Project 2 - TDS Solver" discussion. The log indicates that the server is receiving numerous "Invalid HTTP request received" warnings, followed by "GET" requests to various URLs, many of which are returning a "404 Not Found" error. These requests are coming from different IP addresses. The log concludes with the application shutting down, waiting for shutdown completion, and the finished server process ID [1320]. This output most likely represents a student encountering issues while running the server and observing a high volume of 404 errors, coupled with warnings of invalid requests, which may point to misconfigured routes or errors in request formatting., **[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image shows server logs from a TDS (Traffic Detection System) solver project discussion, where the server is receiving a barrage of HTTP requests, many of which result in "404 Not Found" errors. The log entries are marked as "INFO" or "WARNING", indicating the severity of the events, and the "WARNING" messages specifically flag "Invalid HTTP request received". The log also captures different IP addresses attempting to access various paths like `/manage/account/login`, `/admin/index.html`, `/login.html`, `/webpages/login.html`, and even sensitive files like `/.env.bak` and `/containers/json`. The log culminates in the server shutting down, waiting for application shutdown, and finally completing the application shutdown process. This could be related to a student's difficulty setting up the web server component, or the server being targeted by automated scanners probing for vulnerabilities. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image captures a student's console output, likely during the execution of their TDS solver project, reflecting a debugging or testing stage. The output primarily consists of "INFO" and "WARNING" messages, revealing the server's behavior while processing HTTP requests. Many "INFO" lines indicate various "GET" requests (e.g., "/manage/account/login", "/admin/index.html", "/.env") resulting in "404 Not Found" errors, implying that the requested resources aren't available on the server. Several "WARNING" lines flag "Invalid HTTP request received", suggesting malformed or unexpected request formats being sent to the server, and the last lines show the server shutting down gracefully. 2x" data-dominant-color="353535">Screenshot 2025-04-06 at 12.37.36 PM1340Ã—1132 196 KB
