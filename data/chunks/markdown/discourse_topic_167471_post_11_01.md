**[Discussion Image by satviksawhney]** This image captures a file directory structure in the context of a student question about a failed project submission. It shows the project's root directory containing folders "Business" and "Operations," and an "app" folder with recently updated Dockerfile and requirements.txt files. Critically, there is also a file named "Dockerfile" at the root level, with the description "Rename dockerfile to Dockerfile," which suggests a case sensitivity issue, i.e. the first is not being recognized as a Dockerfile. The student's confusion likely stems from the presence of the Dockerfile and the project still failing. The resolution outcome, based on the suggested file naming convention, likely resolves to ensure the Dockerfile is correctly identified by the system.ct still failed. This highlights a common point of confusion for students: ensuring the Dockerfile is correctly named and located in the project root." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 1.53.10 PM" data-base62-sha1="3Lil8Qu84E3T6jREDGJRO6bakiN" width="690" height="170" srcset="**[Discussion Image by satviksawhney]** This image shows the file structure of a project that was submitted by a student, possibly on GitHub, as evidenced by the folder and file icons, dark theme, and right-side navigation icons. The key issue is the "Dockerfile" which should be at the root level, is shown as "dockerfile" and then has a commit message of "Rename dockerfile to Dockerfile". This likely caused the automated project checker to fail the submission, since Dockerfile filenames are case-sensitive. Other files in the root directory include LICENSE and README.md, along with directories for "Business", "Operations", and "app". The "app" directory contains "Updated Dockerfile and requirements.txt", indicating the student correctly created and modified these files at some point., **[Discussion Image by satviksawhney]** This image shows a file directory structure related to a TDS project submission, where the student, Satviksawhney, is experiencing confusion about a "FAIL" mark despite having a Dockerfile. The root directory contains folders "Business", "Operations", and "app", with the "app" folder containing updated Dockerfile and requirements.txt files from two days ago. Critically, there is also a standalone file named "dockerfile" (lowercase), alongside a correctly capitalized "Dockerfile" at the root. A commit message indicates a renaming operation: "Rename dockerfile to Dockerfile", suggesting a previous naming error, which might be causing the failure, because Docker expects Dockerfile to be uppercase. Other files present are "LICENSE" and "README.md". 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by satviksawhney]** This image depicts a file system view from a student project, showing directory structure and files. It includes folders named "Business", "Operations", and "app", along with files such as "Dockerfile", "LICENSE", and "README.md". Critically, the "Dockerfile" entry shows that the student renamed "dockerfile" to "Dockerfile" yesterday. This indicates the student likely corrected a case-sensitivity issue, a common source of Docker build failures. The timestamps suggest modifications happened recently, possibly in response to project feedback. The overall context points to a student troubleshooting a project submission with Docker-related issues. 2x" data-dominant-color="15181D">Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 1.53.10 PM1889×467 54 KB
