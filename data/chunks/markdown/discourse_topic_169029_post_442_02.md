Hello @Saransh_Saini , @Jivraj

Sir When i test it locally , my LLM is working fine , even running the app , it gave result in 2 sec ,

I dont know what happened in the logs , it was showing some runtime error ,

As i am using free plan of vercel , so it allow for 10 sec only ,

I think any heavy file being run , so it just take some more time , more than 10 sec , but inbuild feature of free plan allow to run only 10 sec … and thats why this happened , i guess

does it means , my LLM failed ??

Can you please try some other question , it will work , or even for heavy question it work ,

You can check its working from interface too

Please check once !!
