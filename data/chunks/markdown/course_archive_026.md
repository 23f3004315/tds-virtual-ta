## Libraries to build web applications

[**[Course Image: Libraries to build web applications]** This image showcases a "Credit Card Default Prediction App," which takes user input parameters to predict the probability of credit card default. The interface allows users to specify inputs such as gender (CODE_GENDER), car ownership (FLAG_OWN_CAR), realty ownership (FLAG_OWN_REALTY), work phone availability (FLAG_WORK_PHONE), email availability (FLAG_EMAIL), and phone availability (FLAG_PHONE). Students can apply this understanding to TDS projects involving model deployment where user interfaces are built for interacting with predictive models. Understanding user input parameters and their role in model prediction is key. These parameters are often archived with prediction results to understand later what parameters predicted the model's output.terface of a "Credit Card Default Prediction App," focusing on input parameters used for the prediction model. The app takes several user inputs, including "CODE_GENDER," "FLAG_OWN_CAR," "FLAG_OWN_REALTY," "FLAG_WORK_PHONE," "FLAG_EMAIL," and "FLAG_PHONE." Users can select values for these parameters through dropdown menus or similar UI elements. This input data is used by the application to predict the probability of credit card default, showcasing a practical application of data analysis and machine learning. Understanding these input features is essential for interpreting and utilizing the app's predictions effectively, showing the corelation of user's data and credit risk.)](https://youtu.be/iT5sS1dWMcc)
