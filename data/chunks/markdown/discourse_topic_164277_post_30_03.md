**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image shows part of the project grading criteria posted by the instructor (Carlton) for the TDS LLM-based Automation Agent project. The instructor outlines the prerequisites that a student's repository *must* meet to be eligible for evaluation. These prerequisites include having a publicly accessible GitHub repository with a LICENSE file (MIT license) and a valid Dockerfile. The instructions also specify that the Docker image must be publicly accessible and runnable using a `podman run` command with environment variables and port mapping: `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`. Finally, the Docker image must be built from the same Dockerfile present in the student's GitHub repository.roject submission and grading.
