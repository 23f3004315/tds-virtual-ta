## Post #205 by Saransh_Saini

**Direct Link**: [Post #205](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/169029/205)

I am going to clarify this once and for all

The response should be a **JSON Object** with the value of the `"answer"` key as a string.

`{ "answer" : "YOUR_ANSWER_AS_STRING" }
`
This is the way we are expecting your responses.

However, due to the heavy confusion among students and will be considering responses with entire JSON objects stringified. We donâ€™t want anyone to loose their marks for such a miniscule error.

So,

`"{\"answer\": \"YOUR_ANSWER\"}"
`
is also valid.
