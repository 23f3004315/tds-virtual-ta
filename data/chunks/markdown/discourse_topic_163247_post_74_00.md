For those who want to experiment with GPT-4o Mini (or other models), Github Models is free. You can explore and compare models, including GPT-4o Mini, DeepSeek R1, and others.

It has rate limits, so you canâ€™t use it in production, but is a good place to prototype applications and experiment with prompts.

Please let me know if you face any problems accessing it.
