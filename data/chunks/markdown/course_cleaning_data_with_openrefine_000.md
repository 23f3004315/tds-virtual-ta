## Cleaning Data with OpenRefine

[**[Course Image: Cleaning data with OpenRefine]** This image showcases the OpenRefine interface with a dataset loaded, displaying key data cleaning functionalities. It highlights the use of "Facets & Filters" on the left-hand side, which allow users to select subsets of data to act upon. The main data grid displays rows of data, with options to adjust the number of rows shown per page (e.g., 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500, 1000). The image also demonstrates navigating through the dataset with pagination controls like "first," "previous," "next," and "last." Students will learn to use these features to explore and clean their data effectively within OpenRefine.rface with an imported dataset, highlighting how to navigate and initially explore the data. The interface displays the dataset in a tabular format, showing columns like `case_id`, `trade_nm`, `legal_name`, `street_addr_1_txt`, and `cty_nm`. At the top, there are controls to manage the display, such as showing 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500, or 1000 rows, and navigation buttons to browse through pages of the data. A key feature emphasized is the "Facet / Filter" panel on the left, which allows users to create subsets of data to act on, accessible from the menus at the top of each data column. This initial exploration helps understand the data's structure and identify areas needing cleaning.)](https://youtu.be/zxEtfHseE84)

This session covers the use of OpenRefine for data cleaning, focusing on resolving entity discrepancies:

- **Data Upload and Project Creation**: Import data into OpenRefine and create a new project for analysis.
- **Faceting Data**: Use text facets to group similar entries and identify frequency of address crumbs.
- **Clustering Methodology**: Apply clustering algorithms to merge similar entries with minor differences, such as punctuation.
- **Manual and Automated Clustering**: Learn to merge clusters manually or in one go, trusting the system's clustering accuracy.
- **Entity Resolution**: Clean and save the data by resolving multiple versions of the same entity using Open Refine.
