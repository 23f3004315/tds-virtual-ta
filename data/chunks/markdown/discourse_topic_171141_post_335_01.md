Good evening sir.

My original project evaluation conducted by IITM gave me 7/20, however the new evaluation gave me 0/20.

**[Discussion Image by 23f1002223]** This image shows an evaluation log from a student's TDS project submission, indicating both successful and failed tasks, reflecting a peer discussion context. The log reveals that while the B9 task of converting and saving data to '/data/b9.html' executed successfully with an HTTP 200 response, the system failed to read '/data/b9.html' later, resulting in a "B9 failed: Cannot read /data/b9.html" error. Similarly, the B10 task, which involves running a datasette server and counting rows, encountered an HTTP 400 error due to a "Bad Request" and a failure to establish a connection, preventing '/data/b10.csv' from being read; ultimately, the student received a score of 7/20. The HTTP 400 error on the B10 task includes details about the connection pool failing to connect to localhost, suggesting a potential issue with the datasette server setup.in a score of 7/20." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="tb883n42c5TMle3vrZL5uPPvaBx" width="361" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1002223]** This image shows the evaluation log for student 23f1002223's TDS project, indicating a peer discussion. The log reveals issues with tasks B9 and B10, specifically failing to read files from "/data/b9.html" and "/data/b10.csv" despite a previous success message for converting and saving data to "/data/b9.html". Additionally, an HTTP 400 Bad Request error occurs when running a datasette query to count rows in "ticket-sales.csv", related to establishing a connection. The student's score is 7/20, and there is a subsequent POST request to an AI proxy, indicating further troubleshooting steps possibly involving external resources. The "cannot read" errors suggest potential file path or permission issues, and the HTTP 400 error may relate to an incorrect SQL query or connection problem., **[Discussion Image by 23f1002223]** This image captures a student's evaluation log from a TDS project, revealing multiple failed tasks. The log shows that Task B9, involving converting a Githubusercontent URL and saving it to `/data/b9.html`, initially appears to succeed with an HTTP 200 status and the message "executed successfully." However, a subsequent HTTP Request attempts to read `/data/b9.html`, resulting in the error "B9 failed: Cannot read /data/b9.html." Similarly, Task B10, which involves running datasette to count rows from 'tickets' and save it to `/data/b10.csv`, also fails with the error "B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv" after an earlier HTTP 400 Bad Request error when attempting to establish a connection to localhost. The final score is 7/20, indicating significant issues with the project execution related to file saving and reading tasks. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1002223]** This image shows an email log from a student project evaluation, likely in TDS. The log reveals a series of HTTP requests and task execution messages. Task B9 aimed to convert a URL and save it to `/data/b9.html`, which initially succeeded, but a subsequent attempt to read the file resulted in a "Cannot read /data/b9.html" error. Task B10 involved running datasette to count rows in `ticket-sales.csv` and save the result, however, this encountered a "400 Bad Request" error along with "Failed to establish a new connection" and also failed to read `/data/b10.csv`. The student's score is 7/20, indicating issues with both B9 and B10, suggesting a problem either with file paths, permissions, or the datasette query construction. 2x" data-dominant-color="C9C8C8">image650Ã—898 106 KB
