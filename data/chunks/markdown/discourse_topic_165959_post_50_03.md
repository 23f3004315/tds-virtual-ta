**[Discussion Image by 23f2003853]** This image depicts a student's attempt to submit their GitHub repository URL in the TDS GA4 course for a data sourcing assignment, showcasing a problem encountered during the automated checking process. The student has entered "https://github.com/23f2003853/workflows" into the "Enter your repository URL" field, which is highlighted in red, indicating an error. Upon clicking the "Check" button, the system returns the error message: "Error: No executed job step matches 23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". This suggests that the automated script expects to find a specific job or workflow execution associated with the student's email address within the provided GitHub repository, likely to verify successful data sourcing implementation. The error implies that the required workflow hasn't been run or is not correctly configured to be identified by the checking system, reflecting a potential misunderstanding of the assignment requirements or an issue with the GitHub Actions setup in the student's repository.com/USER/REPO". The student entered "https://github.com/23f2003853/workflows", which triggers the error message: "Error: No executed job step matches 23f2003853@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". This suggests the system is trying to find a specific executed job step within the provided repository related to the student's email address, likely for verification or grading purposes, and the provided URL isn't leading to that expected job execution record. The student likely needs to ensure that their GitHub workflow has been properly executed and is linked to their student account via their IITM email. A "Check" button is visible, indicating that the student attempted validation by clicking it." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="hDN66iiTawbOYgwRX9PxvkLbmJy" width="690" height="113" data-dominant-color="F8F4F6">image1122Ã—184 5.81 KB
