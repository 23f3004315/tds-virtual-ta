**[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image depicts a student's attempt to deploy a Python application to Vercel and expose an API as part of the GA2 assignment, specifically related to using deployment tools in a TDS (The Data Science) Jan 2025 cohort. The student is instructed to download a `q-vercel-python.json` file containing marks for 100 imaginary students, create an API endpoint such that a request like `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y` returns a JSON response with the marks for students X and Y, and enable CORS. The student provides a Vercel URL (`https://vercel-project-three-liard.vercel.app/api`) as their answer, but receives an error message indicating that the expected output `[35,71,83,96,95]` was not received, instead, the API returned `[null,null,null,null,null]`. This suggests an issue with how the student's API is processing the request or accessing the student marks data from the JSON file, or there might be a potential error in variable names being passed through URL.orrect marks (or any marks at all) for the default test names. The student is likely struggling with properly extracting student names from the query parameters in the URL and fetching their marks from the provided JSON data within their Python application." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-30 024723" data-base62-sha1="gG5L0BkvoV7I9jxpBhx2xw8FFrj" width="690" height="311" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image depicts a student's attempt to answer a question related to deploying a Python application to Vercel and exposing an API, likely part of the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" assignment. The task involves creating an API endpoint that, when called with name parameters (e.g., `name=X&name=Y`), returns a JSON response containing the marks for those names. The student provided the Vercel URL `https://vercel-project-three-liard.vercel.app/api` but received an error. The error message "Expected [35,71,83,96,95] but got [null,null,null,null,null]" indicates that the API is not returning the correct marks for the input names, likely because the student's code is failing to retrieve or process the marks correctly, returning `null` values instead of the expected numeric marks. The task also emphasizes enabling CORS to allow GET requests from any origin., **[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image captures a student's attempt to answer a question related to deploying a Python app to Vercel and creating an API endpoint. The question asks the student to deploy a Python app to Vercel such that a GET request to `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y` returns a JSON response in the format `{"marks": [10, 20]}` and ensure CORS is enabled. The student enters a Vercel URL of `https://vercel-project-three-liard.vercel.app/api` in response to the question "What is the Vercel URL?". The response produces an error: "Error: Expected [35,71,83,96,95] but got [null,null,null,null,null]", indicating that the returned values from the API endpoint are not matching the expected marks. This shows the student's confusion point is likely related to the API endpoint not returning the correct marks or data. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image captures a student's attempt to deploy a Python app to Vercel and expose an API as part of a TDS GA2 assignment, with the discussion occurring on the "GA2 - Deployment Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]". The assignment involves creating a Python app that takes names as input (name=X&name=Y) and returns a JSON response with the marks of those names, while also enabling CORS for GET requests. The student provided their Vercel URL (https://vercel-project-three-liard.vercel.app/api) as the answer, but received an error message: "Error: Expected [35,71,83,96,95] but got [null,null,null,null,null]", indicating that the API is not returning the expected marks for the given names. This suggests a problem with the logic in the student's Python code related to retrieving and returning the correct marks based on the input names. 2x" data-dominant-color="292F30">Screenshot 2025-01-30 0247232634Ã—1189 196 KB
