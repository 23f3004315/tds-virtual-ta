 about who the audience is, and what are they aware of, and what they aren’t…In short, it failed to implement any of the very matter it speaks of - Understanding the problem.

Summary. I feel the course is offered too early. Rather, I took it a little too early.

Definitely, I can’t relate to most things the speaker is talking about. At least, I don’t see how and where the ideas will gel with our program. I’m sure it does, but now, I don’t know how.

Sorry, I’d never been as critical about anything as this one. I just had to. I’m willing to hear different opinions.

I’m awaiting the announcement from IIT for the course drop.
