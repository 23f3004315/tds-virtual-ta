I encountered the same issue with `evaluate.py`. However, since you previously advised against coding strictly with `evaluate.py`, I didn’t pursue it further. Now, I’m concerned—how is this a mistake?

**[Discussion Image by 23f2000237]** This image depicts a snippet from a TDS student discussion, specifically showcasing a test case failure. The file being examined is `/data/logs-latest.txt`. The image displays the "EXPECTED" output and the "RESULT" output, which are identical in the provided text, yet the test case "A5" is marked as "FAILED," indicating a discrepancy not immediately obvious from the text itself. This suggests there could be hidden characters, whitespace differences, or other subtle variations not visible. The student likely posted this to ask for help understanding why the test is failing.ts the expected lines of text, while the "RESULT" section shows the actual lines of text produced by the student's code. In this specific case, the "EXPECTED" and "RESULT" are identical, but the test still failed, indicating a potential issue beyond the literal text output, such as an incorrect number of lines, formatting, or hidden characters that the diff tool is picking up, prompting the student to investigate further. The identical nature of the expected and resulting text, yet a failed test, highlights a point of confusion for the student regarding the criteria for passing the test case. It presents a debugging scenario where the student needs to examine factors beyond the immediately visible textual content to identify the root cause of the failure." alt="Screenshot (56)" data-base62-sha1="9Mog0nVzFPLg21siivqYUrUFaqZ" width="690" height="167" data-dominant-color="F3F3F3">Screenshot (56)1492×362 22.9 KB
