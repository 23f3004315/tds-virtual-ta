**[Discussion Image by 22f2001175]** The image shows a student attempting a task involving listing files and their attributes using PowerShell and getting an incorrect answer. The student downloaded a "list files attributes.zip" file and extracted it. The task requires using a PowerShell command to list all files in a folder, their date and file size, and then calculating the total size of all files at least 1235 bytes large and modified on or after Wed, 6 Nov, 2019, 10:48 AM IST. The PowerShell command used includes `Get-ChildItem`, `Where-Object` (filtering by `length` and `lastwritetime`), and `Measure-Object` (to get the sum of the lengths). The student submitted "507162" as the total size, but the platform indicates "Incorrect. Try again", and the prompt warns against copying from inside the ZIP file or using Windows Explorer to unzip, as this can destroy the timestamps; instead, it suggests using 7-zip or similar utilities.s the student not to copy files directly from inside the ZIP or use Windows Explorer to unzip, as this can destroy timestamps, suggesting using 7zip or similar utilities." alt="Untitled design" data-base62-sha1="bGs1tmdd72KIQwfbrZwLuHW1dlf" width="353" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f2001175]** This image depicts a student's attempt to complete an assignment regarding listing file attributes using PowerShell. The student downloaded and extracted the "list_files_attributes.zip" file, and is using PowerShell to determine the total size of files at least 1235 bytes large and modified on or after Wed, 6 Nov, 2019, 10:48 AM IST. The PowerShell commands used included `Get-ChildItem` with `Where-Object` to filter files based on size and last modification time, ultimately aiming to sum the `length` property of the filtered files. The student's initial submission of "507162" resulted in an "Incorrect. Try again" error message on the assignment platform, suggesting the answer derived from the PowerShell output was incorrect. The prompt explicitly warns against extracting files using Windows Explorer to avoid timestamp issues and recommends using `7-zip` or similar utilities., **[Discussion Image by 22f2001175]** This image depicts a student's attempt to answer a question about listing files and their attributes using PowerShell. The student downloaded and extracted a zip file, and is trying to determine the total size of files meeting certain criteria, but the submission "507182" is marked as incorrect. The task description instructs to use "ls" (likely referring to the Get-ChildItem cmdlet in PowerShell) to list files with options for date and size, and it is highlighted not to use Windows Explorer for unzipping due to timestamp issues, suggesting to use `unzip` or `7-zip` instead. The student shows PowerShell commands attempting to filter files by length and last write time, using `Get-ChildItem`, `Where-Object`, and `Measure-Object` to find the sum of file lengths. The student's approach aims to filter by file length (greater than or equal to 1235) and last write time (on or after 11/06/2019 10:48:00) using PowerShell cmdlets. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f2001175]** This image depicts a student's attempt at a programming assignment and their subsequent incorrect submission. The task involves downloading a zipped file ("q-list-files-attributes.zip"), extracting it correctly using a tool like `unzip` or `7-Zip` (as Windows Explorer can modify timestamps), and then using the command line to determine the total size of files meeting specific criteria (at least 1235 bytes and modified on or after November 6, 2019, 10:48 am IST). The student executes a PowerShell command to accomplish this, filtering `Get-ChildItem` output by file length and last write time, piping to `Measure-Object` to sum the lengths, and saving a file named result.txt. The student extracts the sum: 507182, but receives an "Incorrect. Try again." message suggesting the extracted result is not correct according to the autograder which includes a timestamp validation. The OCR output shows the student's commands, PowerShell script and file listing. The instructions emphasize preserving timestamps during extraction, indicating that the timestamp information is crucial to solving this assignment correctly. 2x" data-dominant-color="9F9E9E">Untitled design1414Ã—2000 349 KB
