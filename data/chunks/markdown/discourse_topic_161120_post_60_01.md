**[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** This image captures a successful Vercel deployment within the TDS Jan 2025 "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion thread, showing the dashboard for the "vercel-ga2" project. The interface displays the Production Deployment with a status of "Ready," indicating a successful deployment 22 hours prior by user mishkat02. Key details include the deployment URL (vercel-ga2-f7a455gq-mishkat02s-projects.vercel.app) and domain (vercel-ga2.vercel.app with +2), with options to view code and access deployment logs. The dashboard also provides buttons for "Connect Git", "Usage", and "Domains" and an active "Visit" button, indicating the deployment is live and ready to be accessed.t "Connect your Project with a Git repository" prompt is still visible below, suggesting the project is not yet linked to Git, potentially contributing to the lack of content rendered. A "Visit" button is present to view the live deployment." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-22 at 3.17.12 PM" data-base62-sha1="4hJuByknFzV9NW27XWIQPSmLTfD" width="690" height="431" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** This image captures a student's Vercel deployment status as part of a discussion about deployment tools. The screenshot is from the Vercel dashboard, specifically the "Project" view for "vercel-ga2" under the user "mishkat02's projects". It shows the production deployment details, including the deployment URL (vercel-ga2-f7a455gq-mishkat02s-projects.vercel.app), the domain (vercel-ga2.vercel.app), and a status of "Ready," indicating a successful deployment 22 hours ago. The interface also provides options to "Connect Git," view "Build Logs," "Runtime Logs," initiate an "Instant Rollback," or "View code", suggesting the student may have questions around these functionalities or the overall status. This is a typical deployment success scenario, providing a base for potential questions or discussions on further steps and features of Vercel., **[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** This image shows a student's Vercel deployment project page named "vercel-ga2" as part of a peer discussion on deployment tools. The student, mishkat02, has successfully deployed the application, indicated by the status "Ready" and the deployment URL "vercel-ga2-f7la455gq-mishkat02s-projects.vercel.app". The "Domains" section lists the active domain as "vercel-ga2.vercel.app," with "+2" suggesting additional domain configurations. Although the app deployed successfully, the thumbnail on the left of the screenshot displays a "404: NOT_FOUND" error, suggesting a potential issue with routing or missing files in the deployed application. The bottom of the interface displays "Connect your Project with a Git repository to create a Production Deployment" with a "Connect Git repository" button, implying the project isn't linked to a Git repository, even though it's deployed. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** This screenshot shows a student's (mishkat02) Vercel dashboard for a project named "vercel-ga2" within the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion thread. The student appears to have successfully deployed the application, as indicated by the "Ready" status, the deployment URL "vercel-ga2.vercel.app", and the "vercel deploy" command in the Source section. However, a screenshot of the deployed site is showing a "404 NOT FOUND" error, suggesting that while the deployment was successful, the application is not routing properly or is missing necessary files. The student has options to view code, access build logs, runtime logs, and instant rollback, with calls to action to connect the project to a Git repository. This seems to be a point of confusion for the student in understanding the difference between successful deployment and a functional application. 2x" data-dominant-color="252323">Screenshot 2025-01-22 at 3.17.12 PM1440Ã—900 83.3 KB
