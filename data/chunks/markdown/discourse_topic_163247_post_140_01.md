 final submission get graded, or is the highest-scoring submission considered?

I’m facing an issue where my score dropped from 8 to 6.5 when I checked all the answers one last time before submitting. I suspect the drop is due to the 3rd and 7th questions.

**[Discussion Image by Jeleshiya]** This image shows a UI section labeled "Recent saves" within the TDS "GA3 - Large Language Models" course discussion. It presents a list of three saved states from February 5th, 2025, each showing a timestamp (11:59:18 PM, 11:30:37 PM, and 10:44:08 PM) and associated score (6.5, 8, and 6.5 respectively). Next to each save is a "Reload" button, presumably to load that particular saved state. This likely appears in the context of a student's question about reloading past work or understanding the scoring system. The student might be asking how to revert to a previous state or how the scoring impacts their project.t based on save states. It displays a list of three recent saves with the option to "Reload" each, along with the date and time of the save (2/5/2025) and a score associated with each save. The saves listed are from 11:59:18 PM with a score of 6.5, 11:30:37 PM with a score of 8, and 10:44:08 PM with a score of 6.5. This suggests students may be experimenting with different model parameters or training approaches and using the save states to revert to previous configurations or compare performance. The differing scores indicate the effectiveness of these configurations." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-06 001446" data-base62-sha1="p73cN8xutUphlHKsqVnr9RkJDU3" width="690" height="252" data-dominant-color="0C221A">Screenshot 2025-02-06 001446810×296 14.8 KB
