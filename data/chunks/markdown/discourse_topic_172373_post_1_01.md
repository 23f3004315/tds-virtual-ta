**[Discussion Image by 24f1001616]** This image represents a multiple-choice question from a past exam (PYQ) within a TDS (The Digital School) student discussion. The question asks which method is best to identify if a log entry's timestamp corresponds to a Saturday, given that 'timestamp' is a method in the datetime library. Four options are provided, each involving a different method to check the day of the week. The correct answer, marked with a green check, is "Check if timestamp.weekday() == 6", which uses the weekday() method to determine if the day is Saturday (where Saturday is represented by the integer 6 in the weekday() convention). The other options using weekday() with `5` (incorrect), strftime('%A') and dayname() methods are marked as incorrect.ight="410" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 24f1001616]** This image shows a multiple-choice question from a TDS student discussion labeled "PYQ doubt," focusing on the datetime library in Python. The question asks which method is best for identifying if a log entry's timestamp corresponds to a Saturday. The available options include checking if `timestamp.weekday()` equals 5 or 6, or checking if `timestamp.strftime('%A')` or `timestamp.dayname()` equal 'Saturday'. The image indicates that the correct answer is checking if `timestamp.weekday() == 6`, which corresponds to Saturday in the `weekday()` method's indexing (where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6). The other options are marked as incorrect with an "x" and the correct answer has a checkmark beside it. This scenario represents a student seeking clarification on a previous year's question (PYQ)., **[Discussion Image by 24f1001616]** This image shows a multiple-choice question from a TDS student discussion, specifically a "PYQ doubt," focusing on the best way to identify if a log entry's timestamp corresponds to a Saturday using methods available in the datetime library. The question presents four options: checking if `timestamp.weekday() == 5`, `timestamp.weekday() == 6`, `timestamp.strftime('%A') == 'Saturday'`, or `timestamp.dayname() == 'Saturday'`. The correct answer is marked as "Check if `timestamp.weekday() == 6`," because `weekday()` returns an integer where 0 is Monday and 6 is Saturday. The other options are incorrect, as indicated by the red 'X' marks. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 24f1001616]** This image depicts a multiple-choice question from a test or quiz, presented as part of a TDS (The Data Science) student discussion about a "PYQ doubt" (Previous Year Question doubt). The question asks which method is best for identifying if a log entry's timestamp corresponds to a Saturday using the datetime library. The options include checking if `timestamp.weekday() == 5`, `timestamp.weekday() == 6`, `timestamp.strftime('%A') == 'Saturday'`, and `timestamp.dayname() == 'Saturday'`. Option 2, "Check if timestamp.weekday() == 6" is marked as the correct answer with a checkmark. The other options are marked as incorrect with a red x. 2x" data-dominant-color="EDEDEC">image1141Ã—678 102 KB
