In the last two question of the ga,it is mentioned including both groups.so what is the meaning of this .

**[Discussion Image by 23f2003751]** This image shows the assignment instructions posted by the instructor in the discussion thread, outlining the task, requirements, and desired outcomes related to extracting data from a PDF. The task involves extracting a table of student marks from "q-extract-tables-from-pdf.pdf" using PDF parsing libraries like Tabula, Camelot, or PyPDF2. The student must then calculate the total Biology marks of students who scored 17 or more in Physics, specifically within groups 43-66, including both group numbers. The instructions detail the steps as: data extraction, data cleaning, data filtering, and calculation, and also describe how automation of such tasks can help EduAnalytics and Greenwood High School in multiple ways like identifying performance trends, allocating resources, enhancing reporting efficiency and supporting data-driven strategies. The final task is a repeat of the title, asking "What is the total Biology marks of students who scored 17 or more marks in Physics in groups 43-66 (including both groups)?"s who scored 17 or more marks in Physics in groups 43-66 (including both groups)? The task context illustrates a use case of how data analytics can inform resource allocation and student support in a school." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="3N5yMP2lTIDZ0I8yDR0z9f3vues" width="690" height="255" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2003751]** This image shows a homework assignment description posted by an instructor in the TDS Jan 2025 GA4 discussion forum. The assignment involves extracting data from a PDF file named "q-extract-tables-from-pdf.pdf," which contains student marks in various subjects, and calculating the total Biology marks of students who scored 17 or more in Physics within groups 43-66. The description outlines a four-step process: Data Extraction (using libraries like Tabula, Camelot, or PyPDF2), Data Cleaning, Data Filtering (marks between 17 and Physics scores between 43-66 inclusive), and Calculation (summing the filtered Biology marks). The task aims to demonstrate how automated analysis of student marks can empower schools to identify performance trends, allocate resources effectively, enhance reporting efficiency, and support data-driven strategies., **[Discussion Image by 23f2003751]** This image depicts a task description within a TDS student discussion forum, outlining a data extraction and analysis problem. The task requires students to download a PDF containing student marks in various subjects, then calculate the total Biology marks of students who scored 17 or more in Physics within specific groups (43-66). The description details the four steps: data extraction using libraries like Tabula or Camelot, data cleaning to convert marks to numerical types, data filtering to identify relevant students, and finally, calculation to sum the marks. The goal is to automate the analysis of student marks, allowing EduAnalytics to help Greenwood High School in making data-driven decisions. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2003751]** This image shows a task description in a TDS student discussion forum, outlining steps to extract, clean, filter, and calculate student marks from a PDF file named "q-extract-tables-from-pdf.pdf". The task requires extracting student marks from the PDF using libraries like Tabula, Camelot, or PyPDF2, converting the marks to numerical data types, identifying students who scored 17 or more in Physics within groups 43-66, and summing the Biology marks of the filtered students. The context suggests the original poster is seeking guidance on how to accomplish this task. The description emphasizes automating the analysis of student marks to enable the school to identify performance trends, allocate resources effectively, enhance reporting efficiency, and support data-driven strategies. 2x" data-dominant-color="2E3236">image1622Ã—601 85.5 KB
