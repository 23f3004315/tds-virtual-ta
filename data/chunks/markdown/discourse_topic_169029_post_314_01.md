 what to do and how to do?

We have made **several hours of videos** on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself.

I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project.

Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared)

They explained what should be your approach? How to make project?

Yes these were explained if you

either took part in any live session or
watched the recorded video

And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times?

I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks.

It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off.

Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words:

Create a server api that receives a request.

The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs.

The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page.
