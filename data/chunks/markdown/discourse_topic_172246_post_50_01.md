1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally.

That is the data for you.

**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image depicts a bar chart titled "Student Bonus," presenting a histogram of the distribution of bonus marks received by students in a class. The x-axis represents the "Bonus" amount, ranging from 0 to 5, while the y-axis indicates the number of "Students" who received that bonus. The chart shows that 23 students received 0 bonus marks, 36 students received 1 bonus mark, a significant 50 students received 2 bonus marks, 2 students received 3 bonus marks, and no students received either 4 or 5 bonus marks. This chart is being used as a peer discussion on the bonus marks distribution within the class.5, and the y-axis indicates the number of students. Specifically, 23 students received 0 bonus marks, 36 students received 1 bonus mark, 50 students received 2 bonus marks, 2 students received 3 bonus marks, and no students received 4 or 5 bonus marks. This visual representation is likely part of a peer discussion to understand the overall performance and bonus distribution within the TDS course, aiming to clarify any discrepancies or misunderstandings about bonus allocation. The chart format allows for a quick understanding of the distribution and relative frequency of different bonus amounts awarded." alt="Student Bonus" data-base62-sha1="deHf28Oaap6ghcEFhqiZc4fCrG" width="600" height="371">Student Bonus600Ã—371 7.62 KB
