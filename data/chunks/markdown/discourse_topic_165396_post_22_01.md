**[Discussion Image by 23ds2000134]** The image shows the "Tools in Data Science" course tile, labeled as "NEW COURSE" in the LMS. Below the tile, it displays "Week 1 Assignment - 0.00", which is likely the student's score for the Week 1 assignment. This indicates that the student's concern is that the grade is not being displayed correctly, or perhaps not reflecting their submission status. The student is likely looking for guidance on how to troubleshoot this display issue. The score of 0.00 suggests either the assignment hasn't been graded yet, or the student has received no points on the assignment.the course title. Below the course title, the student's "Week 1 Assignment" grade is displayed as "- 0.00". This indicates the student is concerned about a potentially missing or unsubmitted assignment and the received score. The discussion thread is about students not being able to see or access their graded assignments." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-30 171404" data-base62-sha1="cRSca2d57PNl1eLs7rxCWBrHkmW" width="432" height="321">Screenshot 2025-01-30 171404432Ã—321 16.6 KB
