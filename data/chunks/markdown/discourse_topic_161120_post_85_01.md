 the image
In the dropdown in “Compress” section, select “OxiPNG”. Left the other options unchanged (Interlace checkbox is unchecked, Effort is at 2).
The resulting image is downloaded which has same pixel size as original image but file size is 1,473 bytes

**[Discussion Image by 23f2005138]** This image depicts a UI for optimizing PNG images, likely shared by a student in a discussion about deployment tools. The UI features an "Edit" section with toggles for "Resize" and "Reduce palette," both currently enabled. The "Compress" section uses "OxiPNG" as the compression method with options for "Interlace" (unchecked) and "Effort" (set to 2), along with a slider to adjust the effort level. The UI shows a 63% size reduction, resulting in a final file size of 1.41 kB, and a download button is available. This could be a screenshot of a student experimenting with image optimization settings and sharing the results, or asking peers about optimal compression parameters for their deployment.ha1="1MWIHnRjGxA3dYKeOpIdLUgwg6W" width="349" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2005138]** This image depicts a UI interface of an image editing/compression tool, likely part of a deployment workflow, showcasing configuration options. Under the "Edit" section, there are toggle switches for "Resize" and "Reduce palette", both shown as activated. The "Compress" section displays a dropdown menu with "OxiPNG" selected as the compression method, an unchecked "Interlace" option, and an "Effort" slider currently set to a value of '2'. Finally, the UI indicates a 63% reduction in file size, resulting in a final file size of 1.41 kB, along with a prominent download button., **[Discussion Image by 23f2005138]** This image illustrates a student's configuration of an image compression tool within the TDS "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion. The UI shows "Edit" and "Compress" sections, with toggles to enable "Resize" and "Reduce palette" and a dropdown menu set to "OxiPNG". The student has chosen not to "Interlace" the image, and has adjusted the compression "Effort" to level 2 via a slider, achieving a 63% reduction in file size down to 1.41 kB, and is about to download the image using the download button on the bottom right. This likely relates to optimizing image assets for deployment, demonstrating a student applying compression techniques and showing their settings, possibly as part of a question or sharing their workflow. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2005138]** This image depicts a UI for image compression settings, likely shared in a student discussion about deployment tools. The UI has sections for "Edit" (with toggles for "Resize" and "Reduce palette") and "Compress". The "Compress" section has options including a dropdown selecting the compression algorithm (currently "OxiPNG"), an "Interlace" checkbox, and an "Effort" slider currently set to 2. At the bottom, it displays a compression rate of 63% and a resulting file size of 1.41 kB, with a download button. This indicates the student is exploring image optimization techniques for deployment, possibly seeking advice or sharing optimal settings. 2x" data-dominant-color="384B57">image398×570 17.5 KB
