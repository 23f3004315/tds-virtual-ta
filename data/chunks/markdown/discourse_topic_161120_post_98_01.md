**[Discussion Image by 23f2003853]** This image captures a student encountering issues with ngrok's multi-factor authentication (MFA) setup during a deployment tools discussion. The ngrok webpage shows a "Device Activation" prompt asking the user to "Enter the code displayed on your device," with the code "4VZTALOCF43MBSGDR63ZL7THHK4B0613" visible in the input field. Upon attempting to continue, an error message appears stating, "The information supplied for MFA verification was invalid," indicating a problem with the provided code. This could be due to an incorrect code entry, a mismatch between the device code and the one expected by ngrok, or a problem with the MFA configuration itself. The user may need to double-check the code or troubleshoot their MFA setup. The browser URL shows the user is on the "dashboard.ngrok.com/login/mfa/setup" page.try, or account setup within ngrok. The student may need to check the correctness of the code, sync device time, or review the MFA setup instructions." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="b0U0rdD91r0mp2wsz7OHyRbgnyT" width="690" height="387" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2003853]** This screenshot captures a student's attempt to set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in ngrok, likely during a deployment tools assignment discussion.
