Request for Clarification on Zero Marks Given – Repository Was Public with All Required Files

Dear @Carlton sir

I wanted to kindly request a clarification regarding the evaluation of my project submission. I noticed that I have been awarded zero marks, and I’m a bit confused because I had made sure that everything was in place.

My GitHub repository was **public** at the time of submission.
I had included the **Dockerfile** as required.
I also added the **MIT License** to the project.
For your reference, I am also attaching a **snapshot** of the repository as it was during the submission time.

Given all these were in place, I would really appreciate it if you could provide a **concrete reason** for giving **zero marks**. I’m eager to understand what went wrong so I can avoid it in the future and improve myself. But u saying in email that my repo was not public , not having dockerfile and not having mit licsence .
