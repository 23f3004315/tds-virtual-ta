**[Discussion Image by 23f2004320]** This image depicts a student dashboard view within a "Tools in Data Science" course, and this is likely a student question, because it shows the grades for each week's assignment and indicates that "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1" is marked as "Absent". The student is viewing the "NEW COURSE" dashboard, seeing assignments from Week 1 through Week 5 and their corresponding scores (85.00, 55.00, 100.00, 100.00, 100.00), suggesting a good record in those assignments, but faces the "Absent" status on the Programming Quiz. The dashboard provides a "Go to Course page >" link at the bottom, likely for navigating to further details and course content. This likely prompts the student to ask why their quiz is marked absent even if submitted correctly in the overall discussion.ayed numerically, but "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1" is labeled as "Absent," which is the problem being discussed in the student forum. This indicates that the student either didn't submit the quiz, the system didn't record the submission, or there's an issue with the grading system itself, prompting the student to seek clarification from peers or instructors. A "Go to Course page >" button is located at the bottom, likely used to access the full course content and potentially the quiz in question. The student is attempting to understand if the "Absent" status reflects a missing submission or a system error related to the quiz." alt="Screenshot 2025-03-07 224052" data-base62-sha1="bQ9ktwmzupz52fPSV8Vz6YfbF5B" width="361" height="500" data-dominant-color="A79393">Screenshot 2025-03-07 224052416×575 29.7 KB
