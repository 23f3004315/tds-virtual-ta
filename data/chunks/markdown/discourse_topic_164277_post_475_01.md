**[Discussion Image by rohitgarg]** This image shows rohitgarg, a student in the TDS Jan 2025 LLM-based Automation Agent project, posting in the discussion thread. Since the image is just a profile picture, it does not contain any specific questions, instructor answers, code snippets, error messages, navigation steps, UI elements, troubleshooting procedures, solutions, workarounds, or learning guidance visible within the image itself. The image merely provides a visual identifier of the student contributing to the discussion. The content and context of the post would need to be determined from the associated text in the discussion thread.profile picture of Rohit, not directly containing any error messages, code snippets, or UI elements related to the project, so the context is limited to identifying him as a participant in the thread. Therefore, the image itself doesn't provide specific problem-solving value for other students." class="onebox-avatar-inline" width="20" height="20" data-dominant-color="89816A">
