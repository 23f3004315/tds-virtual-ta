**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image illustrates a comparison between Virtual Machines (VMs) and Containers, likely used within the "GA2 - Deployment Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]". On the left, it visually represents VMs as isolated servers (with email, webserver, and database components), each running on top of virtual machines displayed on a monitor, signifying their resource-intensive nature. Conversely, on the right side, it shows containers as smaller application deployments residing on a single server, labeled "POWERCERT", emphasizing their resource efficiency and lighter footprint. The image acts as a learning resource aimed at helping students understand the differences between these deployment strategies, which is a common topic in deployment tools discussions. It seems that the student is trying to grasp fundamental differences between VMs and containers to better engage in discussion related to the deployment tools, since these tools often rely on these techinques. The post probably acts as an educational element to improve student comprehension.al machines with applications such as Email, Webserver and Database, and operating systems like Windows and Linux, all running on Virtual Machines. On the right side, the image represents the container approach, showing multiple "Applications" hosted within a server, labeled "Powecert," which is segmented into "Containers". The large text "VMs vs CONTAINERS" is centered in the image, with the word "ANIMATED" at the bottom, implying the comparison might be part of a video or presentation within the deployment tools discussion. This image is used in TDS Jan 2025 course." title="Virtual Machines vs Containers" data-dominant-color="356458" width="690" height="388">
