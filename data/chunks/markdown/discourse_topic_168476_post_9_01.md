Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # #
Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # #
LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # #
The ROE is hard. #

**Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course.** Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.

TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - *Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help*

Again to quote Anand:

[Quote]: 
**We encourage learning by sharing**

You *CAN* copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).

**Why should you copy?** Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.

**To learn well, understand** what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.

**To learn better, teach** what you’ve learnt.
