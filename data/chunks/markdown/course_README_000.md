# Tools in Data Science

[Tools in Data Science](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/course_pages/BSSE2002.html) is a practical diploma level data science course at IIT Madras that teaches
popular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production.

**This course exposes you to real-life tools**

Courses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.

But one critical subject that's rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?

These tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:

- You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you'll have to scrape them yourself.
- You learn how to train models. But soon, you'll just pick something from HuggingFace.
- You learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a `sed` + `grep` script in minutes.

[**[Course Image: ]** This XKCD comic illustrates the difference between the idealized vision of a technology and the pragmatic reality of its implementation, a theme relevant when choosing tools or documenting decisions in a README. The comic shows someone achieving "enlightenment" and believing Lisp is the language from which the gods wrought the universe, only to be told, "Honestly, we hacked most of it together with Perl." It highlights that a README should honestly reflect how a project was built, even if it wasn't with the most elegant or theoretically pure tools. This honesty helps others understand the project's history, dependencies, and potential quirks, leading to better maintainability. The key takeaway is to avoid romanticizing your technology choices in the README and to focus on providing an accurate representation of the project's creation and current state. "We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You'll have to decode the regexes yourself."](https://explainxkcd.com/224/)

In this course, we've curated the most important tools people use in data science.

Learn them well. You'll be a **_lot_ more productive** than your peers.

**This course is quite hard**
