**[Discussion Image by 21F1005510]** This image shows a student's debugging process while working with data in the "GA4 - Data Sourcing" discussion thread. The student is likely attempting to retrieve movie data, specifically titles and ratings, from a website, evidenced by the IMDB search results visible in the left portion of the image for titles with ratings between 4.0 and 8.0. The right side of the image shows the browser's developer console, specifically the "Console" tab, where JSON data is displayed. The JSON data contains an array of movie objects, each with "id", "title", "year", and "rating" fields. The data includes movie titles such as "Gladiator II", "Babygirl", "High Potential", "Anora", "Blink Twice", and "Back in Action" along with their respective years and ratings, suggesting the student is trying to extract structured data from the IMDB website, possibly for use in a GA4 implementation.data being retrieved, which can inform the data sourcing process. This might be part of a discussion where the student is verifying data accuracy, troubleshooting data retrieval, or asking for guidance on data manipulation for GA4 integration." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="7OfSddj1NoLNDNie9abjyIzZJl1" width="690" height="388" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 21F1005510]** This image depicts a student's attempt to extract movie data from IMDB using the browser's developer tools, likely as part of a data sourcing task for GA4. The student is viewing a list of movies with ratings between 4.0 and 8.0 on the IMDB website. The right side of the screenshot shows the "Console" tab in the browser's developer tools, where JSON data structures representing the movie data are printed, including movie IDs, titles, years, and ratings (e.g., `"id": "tt9232138", "title": "12. Gladiator II", "year": "2024", "rating": "6.6"`). The student is attempting to extract information such as title, year, and rating directly from the website's data structure using browser tools, which is a potential method to source data if an official API is not available or easily accessible. This helps illustrate the process of identifying data sources and accessing them using front-end web development tools., **[Discussion Image by 21F1005510]** The image depicts a student investigating data sourcing on IMDB, likely for a GA4 project, as part of the TDS Jan 2025 cohort discussion. The student has navigated to an IMDB search page (imdb.com/search/title/?user_rating=4,8) filtering movies by user ratings between 4.0 and 8.0. They've opened the browser's developer tools (Chrome DevTools), specifically the "Console" tab, which displays a JSON object containing movie data, including 'id', 'title', 'year', and 'rating' for several movies like "Gladiator II," "Babygirl," and "High Potential." The student likely extracted this JSON to understand the available data structure and potentially build a data sourcing strategy for their project. This indicates a student trying to understand the data structure they are working with and likely extracting the data for use in their GA4 project. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 21F1005510]** This image shows a student exploring data sourcing for GA4 using an IMDb movie search. The student has filtered IMDb to display movies with user ratings between 4.0 and 8.0, as seen in the URL `imdb.com/search/title/?user_rating=4,8`. They are examining the JSON response in the browser's developer console (Elements tab), which includes movie titles, release years, and ratings. The console displays structured JSON data for movies like "Gladiator II," "Babygirl," "Anora," and "Flight Risk," including their IDs, titles, release years and user ratings. The student seems to be inspecting the structure of this data source for potential use in their GA4 project, and checking that the search result matches the URL query. 2x" data-dominant-color="EAEBEB">image1920Ã—1080 159 KB
