**[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** This image shows a student question related to a TDS project involving SQLite database queries. The context presents a `tickets` table with columns `type`, `units`, and `price`, representing customer bids for concert tickets. The table data displayed includes ticket types like "bronze", "Bronze", "Silver", and "SILVER" along with corresponding units and prices, implying the data is case-sensitive. The question asks to write an SQL query to calculate the total sales for "Gold" ticket types, and there is a dark grey box, indicating a place to add code, below the prompt. concert tickets. The table shows examples of ticket types like 'bronze', 'Bronze', 'Silver', and 'SILVER' with corresponding units and prices. The question asks: "What is the total sales of all the items in the 'Gold' ticket type? Write SQL to calculate it." The subsequent section of the post (represented by a dark grey box) is where the student would enter their SQL code to solve this problem." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="fqiVVG18vxnjRtbXFg21E5J0eoy" width="690" height="446" data-dominant-color="D1D2D3">image859Ã—556 23 KB
