The evaluation shows that the Docker image is present and public on Docker Hub (PASS), but the GitHub repository is failing the check for being present and public, along with the presence of a Dockerfile and MIT license in the root of the GitHub repository (FAIL). The overall prerequisites check failed and the project score is 0, suggesting the student needs to make the repository public and ensure the Dockerfile and MIT license are located in the root directory of the repository. Therefore, the student needs to ensure their GitHub repo is public and contains a Dockerfile and MIT License in its root directory. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by lakshaygarg654]** This image is from a student's discussion post regarding project 1 prerequisite evaluations. The evaluations show that while the Docker image is present and public on Docker Hub, the Github repository is failing because it's not recognized as present and public. Additionally, the Dockerfile and MIT license are not found in the root of the Github repo. Due to these failures, the student's prerequisites are failing, resulting in a project 1 score of 0. The student is likely seeking assistance in troubleshooting why the Github repo, Dockerfile, and MIT license checks are failing despite potentially believing they have correctly set them up. 2x" data-dominant-color="2F2E32">10004314101080Ã—551 159 KB
