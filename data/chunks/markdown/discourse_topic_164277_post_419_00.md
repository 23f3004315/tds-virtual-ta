## Post #419 by 23f3000709

**Direct Link**: [Post #419](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/164277/419)

hey I have a few doubts, if something was said about this please say so.

in Phase be tasks do we have to store the output in files or just return it in the response
When I call my some of my endpoints using post man or CURL they work but if I run the evaluate.py it throws an error, this I think is a bug in the eval.py file.

any idea about these ?
