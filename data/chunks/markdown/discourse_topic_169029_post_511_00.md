## Post #511 by 23f2001738

**Direct Link**: [Post #511](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/169029/511)

MY Project 2 status is currently marked as Absent in the course dashboard. However, I would like to clarify that I submitted the repository and API endpoints well before the deadline through the designated forum.

Additionally, my Vercel server is still active, and the API is functioning correctly, as can be verified here:

I kindly request you to review my submission
