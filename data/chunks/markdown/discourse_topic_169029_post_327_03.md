**[Discussion Image by 21f2000588]** This image shows a successful server response (Code 200) in the TDS Solver project discussion, specifically focusing on the response body received. The response body contains a JSON object with the key "answer," holding a long hexadecimal string, which is likely the solution to a puzzle or problem in the project. A "Download" button is present in the UI, allowing the student to download the response body, likely to analyze or use the answer in their code. This indicates a student is reviewing the output of their TDS Solver implementation, potentially debugging or verifying its correctness, and the discussion involves a peer or instructor reviewing such output. The extracted answer string is "7a5955793fe63e199006776330053c501100665892532806165924".iscussion Image by 21f2000588]** This image is a screenshot of a server response with code 200, indicating a successful request. The response body is a JSON object containing a field called "answer", with a long hexadecimal string as its value. This is likely the solution being returned by the TDS Solver for Project 2, and students are using this interface to view the results. The download button suggests a way to save this response. The student likely needs this "answer" to pass validation., **[Discussion Image by 21f2000588]** This image depicts a server response with a status code of 200, indicating success. The response body is a JSON object containing a single field named "answer," the value of which is a long, seemingly random hexadecimal string: "7a5955793fe63e199d0677cd33f0053c50110d66589253280b11be96c598df24d8". A "Download" button is visible next to the JSON object, likely allowing the student to download the response data. The presence of the answer in the response suggests this is likely part of a successful call to the TDS solver API, and the student is examining the result. The discussion surrounding this may involve verifying this "answer" or further processing the result. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 21f2000588]** This image depicts the server response from the TDS Solver API, indicating a successful request (Code 200). The response body is in JSON format, containing a single key "answer" with a long hexadecimal string as its value: "7a5955793fe63e199d0677d33f0053c50110d66589253280b1be96c598df24d8". A "Download" button is shown next to the JSON response, implying the user can download the response. This likely occurs within a web-based testing or debugging interface, and represents the expected output format for Project 2. The hexadecimal string represents the solved TDS puzzle, indicating a possible submission or successful test case. 2x" data-dominant-color="A9B3B2">image1806Ã—235 10.1 KB
