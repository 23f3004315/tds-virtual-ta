**[Discussion Image by AryanTikam]** This image shows a student's attempt to format the `/data/format.md` file using prettier, resulting in a series of errors. The first error is an "HTTP/1.1 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR" during a POST request to `localhost:8365/run`, indicating a problem on the server-side. The error details reveal "Task handling error: Failed to get LLM response after 3 attempts" and an authentication issue: "Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer," pointing to a problem with authentication configuration. Subsequently, a GET request to `localhost:8365/read?path=/data/format.md` returns an "HTTP/1.1 400 BAD REQUEST," and the process fails with the message "A2 failed: Cannot read /data/format.md," meaning the script cannot find or access the specified file. The student is encountering both authentication and file access problems while trying to run the formatting task, likely needing to address the authentication setup and verify the file path.th a final error of "Internal server error". Subsequently, a GET request to read the file results in a 400 Bad Request, and the system reports "A2 failed: Cannot read /data/format.md," signaling a file access problem, compounding the initial server-side issue with potential file permission or existence issues." alt="1000004190" data-base62-sha1="f8POUeYUc14WP3S01hUZIrrPUOW" width="519" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by AryanTikam]** This image depicts a student's error messages during a TDS project, specifically while attempting to format the `/data/format.md` file using `prettier@3.4.2`. The error logs show an initial HTTP 500 Internal Server Error after a POST request to `localhost:8365/run`, indicating a task handling error related to failing to get an LLM response due to an authentication token issue ("Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer."). Subsequently, a GET request to `localhost:8365/read` for the same file results in an HTTP 400 Bad Request, and the system reports "A2 failed: Cannot read /data/format.md", signifying that the file is inaccessible. This suggests a problem with either authentication, file permissions, or the server-side processing of the formatting task., **[Discussion Image by AryanTikam]** This image depicts a student encountering errors while running a "Format" task on the file `/data/format.md` using `prettier@3.4.2` within a TDS project, indicating a troubleshooting scenario. The initial HTTP POST request to `http://localhost:8365/run` results in a "500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR," and the details reveal an authentication token issue ("Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.") after multiple attempts to get an LLM response. Subsequently, an HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:8365/read?path=/data/format.md` returns a "400 BAD REQUEST" error, leading to the "A2 failed: Cannot read /data/format.md" message, suggesting file access problems are preventing the task from completing. The student's attempt to format the file fails due to a combination of authentication and file access errors, possibly related to incorrect credentials or insufficient permissions. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by AryanTikam]** This image depicts a student encountering errors while running a formatting task in the TDS project, indicating a peer discussion. The error messages show that the task "Format `/data/format.md` with `prettier@3.4.2` in-place" resulted in an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error, detailed by the message "Task handling error: Failed to get LLM response after 3 attempts: Error code: 401 {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}". Subsequently, a GET request to read the file `/data/format.md` resulted in an HTTP 400 Bad Request, with the error "A2 failed: Cannot read /data/format.md", suggesting an authentication or file access issue. This points to the student's confusion around authentication token validity and potentially file path issues within the environment. 2x" data-dominant-color="131313">10000041901193Ã—1149 136 KB
