[**[Course Image: 2025-01-28 Week 3 - Session 1 - TDS Jan 25]** This image represents the title card for "Week 3, Session 1" of the TDS (likely The Data Science) course held on January 28, 2025. The session is structured as a live event, indicated by "Live Session: 28 Jan 2025" in the surrounding context. The image sets the stage for the educational content covered in that session, which will likely focus on data science concepts, tools, or techniques. The visuals on the card (graphs, charts, network diagrams) suggest that the session will deal with data analysis and visualization. After this session, students are expected to have a better grasp of the covered data science techniques.covered in Week 3, Session 1, of the TDS (presumably The Data Science) course, specifically on January 28, 2025. The image visually signifies a module related to data science, potentially covering data analysis, visualization, or machine learning concepts. Expect this session to delve into intermediate data science topics, building upon foundational knowledge from the previous weeks. The session will likely use tools and techniques to interpret and present data insights effectively. Students should be prepared to apply these learnings to practical data science projects and assignments.)](https://youtu.be/lmSMQ5LWa30)

**Q1: Can I ask a question about the graded assignment for week one?**

**A1:** I'll try to answer it at the end of the session if there's time. We'll also have extra sessions this week, and we're hoping to release video solutions showing how to solve some of the assignments. But for now, let's focus on today's session.

**Q2: I posted a question on the Discourse forum about the assignment. Should I ask it again now?**

**A2:** No need to ask it again. I'll look at the forum later.

**Q3: DeepSeek is in the news. Does that affect the course?**

**A3:** Not really. The core concept remains the same: using LLMs as agents. The workflow is similar whether you use OpenAI, Anthropic, Copilot, or other AI tools.

**Q4: What is the concept behind Project One?**
