**[Discussion Image by 23f2003853]** This image shows a student's attempt to input an ngrok URL into a web form during a deployment exercise in the TDS "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion. The instructions prompt the student to download Llamafile, run a specific model, and create an ngrok tunnel. The student has entered an ngrok URL (https://6eb1-27-7-78-14.ngrok-free) into the provided text box, but the interface displays an error message "Error: Response is not valid JSON: error code: 1016" below it. The student's issue seems to be related to the format or validity of the ngrok URL, possibly indicating a problem with the ngrok setup or the URL's syntax preventing the application from correctly parsing the response. They have the option to "Check" or "Save", likely for validating the URL and submitting the form, respectively.file, run a specific model, and create a tunnel using ngrok. The student has entered an ngrok URL resembling `https://6eb1-27-7-78-14.ngrok-free.app/`, but the system returns an error: "Response is not valid JSON: error code: 1016," suggesting an issue with the response format from the provided ngrok URL, which would then prevent validating the entered value. The presence of "Check" and "Save" buttons indicates an attempt to validate or submit the URL, but the error blocks the process. The student seems to be following instructions and likely needs to troubleshoot the ngrok setup or address the JSON response issue for successful deployment." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="ukS9M8hBlqTa8GohB6kFDpDu6Vb" width="690" height="181" data-dominant-color="FBFAFB">image1326Ã—349 8.53 KB
