**[Discussion Image by 23f2001286]** This image from a student discussion thread shows a Visual Studio Code window error. The error message, "The window is not responding," prompts the user to reopen, close, or keep waiting and also offers an option to not restore editors upon reopening. The error appeared while the student was writing code involving accessing an environment variable "AIPROXY" using `os.environ.get("AIPROXY")`. The student likely encountered this issue while working on the LLM-based Automation Agent project, indicating a potential delay or resource issue with VS Code during development. It is unclear if this is a student question, or simply reporting a common issue.wing a roadblock they have encountered. The code visible in the background includes an environment variable access using `os.environ.get("AIPROXY")`, suggesting the student is working with environment configurations. The error might be related to a computationally intensive process in the student's code, possibly involving the use of the "AIPROXY" environment variable and causing VS Code to freeze. The student is probably seeking guidance on how to resolve this non-responsive behavior of their VS Code environment during the TDS Project 1 related to LLM-based automation." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="rgWFukcvzbPAVGQTtNCeVY8TbMv" width="690" height="317" data-dominant-color="4A4B4B">image929Ã—427 11.7 KB
