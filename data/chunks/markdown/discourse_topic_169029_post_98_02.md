**[Discussion Image by lakshaygarg654]** This image displays a sample data set structured in a table format, possibly for a data analysis or modeling exercise related to the TDS Solver project. The table includes columns such as TransactionID, Customer Name, Country, Date, Product/Code, Sales, and Cost, providing a structured set of features for each transaction. Each row represents an individual transaction with specific details related to the customer, product, location, date, and financial metrics. The dataset contains mixed data types, including numerical IDs, categorical names and codes, date formats, and numerical sales and cost values denoted in USD. This data could be used to explore customer purchasing patterns, sales trends by country or product, and cost analysis. Country, Date, Product/Code, Sales, and Cost. The Sales and Cost columns are denominated in USD. There is no indication of a specific question, answer, or error message; rather, the data is likely provided as an example or to illustrate a specific aspect of the TDS solver project. This data could be used for tasks like calculating profit, analyzing sales trends by customer or country, or exploring relationships between product codes and costs. It serves as a concrete instance for students to test their TDS solver implementations and problem-solving approaches." alt="friend data" data-base62-sha1="44GCKKbbLnhDqsoaago0XJzY3h4" width="517" height="256" data-dominant-color="EBEBEB">friend data938×465 20.5 KB
