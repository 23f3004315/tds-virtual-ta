There might be some glitches in the system. Could you kindly verify the process again?

**[Discussion Image by lakshaygarg654]** This image shows an email received by a student regarding the prerequisite checks for Project 1 in a TDS course, indicating a potential issue with their submission. The email details the five prerequisites, including the GitHub repository being public and accessible, having an MIT license, containing a valid Dockerfile, and the Docker image being publicly accessible and runnable. The email also presents the results of the student's prerequisite evaluations: Docker image is present and public (PASS), but the GitHub repository being present and public, the Dockerfile's presence in the root of the GitHub repo, and the MIT license's presence are all failing (FAIL). Consequently, the student's prerequisites are marked as FAIL, resulting in a Project 1 score of 0. The student needs to ensure their GitHub repository is public, that the Dockerfile and MIT license are present in the root directory of the repository to pass these checks. root, and the MIT license were all marked as FAIL, resulting in an overall prerequisite failure and a project score of 0. This indicates that the student needs to address issues with their GitHub repository's visibility, Dockerfile location, and the presence of an MIT license file to meet the project's initial requirements." alt="1000430602" data-base62-sha1="inhkCz9MkKtkDK3tKRKZEdZxxdk" width="223" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by lakshaygarg654]** This image shows an email received by a student regarding the Project 1 prerequisite evaluations. The email outlines the necessary conditions for the project, including a publicly accessible GitHub repository with a MIT license and a valid Dockerfile, as well as a publicly accessible Docker image that uses the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository, and can run with a `podman run` command. The student's evaluation results show that while the Docker image is present and public, the GitHub repository is failing the checks for being present, public, having the Dockerfile in the root directory, and having the MIT license. Consequently, the project prerequisites are marked as "FAIL" and the project score is 0, indicating the project will not be evaluated until these requirements are met. This represents an instructor providing automated feedback on initial project setup issues, which the student must resolve., **[Discussion Image by lakshaygarg654]** This image shows an email from TDS (The Data Science) course staff to a student, outlining the prerequisite checks for Project 1 and providing the results of those checks. The email details five requirements: a publicly accessible GitHub repository, an MIT license file in the repository, a valid Dockerfile in the repository, a publicly accessible Docker image that runs via a specific `podman run` command, and that the Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository. The email then presents the student's Project 1 prerequisite evaluations, where the Docker image being present in Docker Hub and public passed, but the GitHub repository being present and public, the Dockerfile being present in the root of the GitHub repository, and the MIT license being present in the root of the GitHub repository all failed, resulting in a FAIL for prerequisites and a Project 1 score of 0. This indicates that the student needs to fix the GitHub repository's visibility, add the Dockerfile and MIT license to the root directory of their GitHub repo to proceed. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by lakshaygarg654]** This image is an email from TDS staff to a student regarding Project 1 prerequisite evaluations. It details the requirements including having a public GitHub repository, a LICENSE file with the MIT license, a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image that can run via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`, and that the Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository. The email shows that the student's Docker image passed the initial check, but the GitHub repository, Dockerfile in the root of the repo, and MIT license in the root of the repo all failed, resulting in an overall prerequisite failure and Project 1 score of 0. The student likely needs to ensure their GitHub repository is public and contains a Dockerfile and MIT license file at the root. 2x" data-dominant-color="28272C">10004306021080Ã—2412 160 KB
