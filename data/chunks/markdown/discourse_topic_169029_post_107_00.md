Questions Requiring Clarification/Manual Intervention for Evaluation (As Discussed in Tuesday’s Session)
Respected TDS Team,

As per the discussion during the Tuesday session, and following @Saransh’s suggestion, I am creating this post to list the questions that may require manual intervention or are facing issues potentially due to portal-side behavior. Kindly verify these points before evaluation.

Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue

GA3 Q8

Issue: The question doesn’t mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag.

GA3 Q9

Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN.
Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation?

GA4 Q2 &amp; Q10

Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved.
Reference: GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution

Output Formatting (Multiple Questions)
