 data for Astana and pasted it in the portal but that doesn’t work as well and throws the following error “TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘id’)”

What am I suppose to do? @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

**[Discussion Image by 23f1001126]** This image shows a student's attempt to answer a question about extracting and transforming weather data from the BBC Weather API for Nur-Sultan within a TDS course assignment, as part of a student discussion on GA4 data sourcing. The task involves retrieving weather data using the locationId, extracting the issueDate and enhancedWeatherDescription, and creating a JSON object with the issuedate as the key and the enhancedWeatherDescription as the value. The student provides a JSON response for the weather forecast, but upon checking, receives a TypeError: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')", indicating an issue with how the locationId or other required API parameters are being handled or are undefined in the code. The expected output format is illustrated above the question, showing example date keys mapped to weather descriptions. The error suggests the student's code likely has a problem accessing the 'id' property, possibly within the API response or during the data extraction process, hindering the successful completion of the data transformation step.ta extraction steps, likely causing a missing or undefined ID property when attempting to process the weather data. The student will likely need to revisit the API integration and data retrieval steps to ensure the location ID is correctly obtained and used in the subsequent API requests to avoid the error." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-09 175948" data-base62-sha1="sXYBd0OC1NeXaqfNam4fv6IQBn1" width="690" height="321" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1001126]** This image depicts a student's attempt to answer a data transformation question in an online assessment related to fetching and processing weather data from the BBC Weather API. The question asks for a JSON weather forecast description for Nur-Sultan, requiring the student to extract `issueDate` and `enhancedWeatherDescription` from the API response's `forecasts` array and map them into a JSON object. The desired output format is provided as an example. The student's attempt includes a JSON structure with dates as keys and weather descriptions as values, but upon checking, it produces a "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')" error, indicating an issue with accessing a property named "id" within the API response, likely during the data extraction process. This suggests a potential problem with how the `locationId` is being used or how the student is attempting to access the `id` property within the API response, potentially due to an incorrect API call or a misunderstanding of the data structure returned by the API., **[Discussion Image by 23f1001126]** This image depicts a student attempting a coding task in a GA4 data sourcing assignment focused on API integration and data transformation. The task requires fetching weather data from the BBC Weather API for Nur-Sultan, extracting relevant information (issueDate and enhancedWeatherDescription), and formatting it into a specific JSON structure. The student's attempt to provide the JSON output results in a "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')" error, indicating an issue with how the 'id' property is being accessed within the code, possibly in relation to the API response. The image shows the expected output format as well as the student's incorrect answer. This indicates a student's confusion regarding proper data handling and API response structure. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1001126]** This image depicts a student's attempt to complete a coding challenge involving weather data retrieval and transformation, likely a homework or assessment exercise. The challenge requires using the BBC Weather API to fetch weather forecasts for Nur-Sultan, extracting relevant data (issueDate and enhancedWeatherDescription), and formatting it into a JSON object. The student has provided a JSON output, attempting to map the dates to weather descriptions, but is encountering a "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')" error, which suggests an issue with how the code is accessing the locationId property from API response during the process of fetching/extracting weather data. The example output format is provided as a hint, and the student has entered their solution in a text input box. 2x" data-dominant-color="222B2D">Screenshot 2025-02-09 1759481823×850 82.3 KB
