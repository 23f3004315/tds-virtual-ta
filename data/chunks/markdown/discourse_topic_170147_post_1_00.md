Dear TDS Team,

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.

1. Graded Assignments (GA)

**GA6 Doubts Unresolved:** While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link)

**GA Platform Changes:** Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to *Seek* and in GA7, to *Google Forms*. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.

2. Project Updates

**Project 1:** The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.
**Project 2:** There are multiple doubts posted in the *Project 2* discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? (thread link)
