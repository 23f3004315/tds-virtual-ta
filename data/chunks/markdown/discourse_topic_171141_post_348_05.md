**[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image displays an autograded feedback report from the TDS project, representing an instructor's grading output to a student. It showcases the student's "veershah1231" submitted GitHub and Docker repository URLs. The report provides a breakdown of the student's grade, beginning with pre-requisite checks including Docker and Github repository existence and public access, LICENSE and Dockerfile checks - all of which passed. Despite the prerequisite successes, the student's task score is 0, bonus is 1, and project 1 score is 1, with the final score calculation shown to be a minimum of 20 or the sum of the task score and the bonus. The grading system informs that evaluation logs are only provided if the API service started working within 5 minutes; otherwise, only a Docker log is available.0, the bonus is 1, and P1 score is 1. The image also displays zero scores across all evaluation metrics (A1-A10, B1-B10, C1-C5) and informs students that evaluation logs are only available if their API service started working within 5 minutes." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="yaxDMke8HoCGdMeRqZ61SmVXbRx" width="690" height="386" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image depicts an instructor's feedback on a student's project submission, specifically focusing on discrepancies in scoring. The instructor provides the formula for the final 't' score: MIN(20, (task score + bonus)), and lists the student's submitted GitHub and Docker repository URLs. It details a pre-requisites check which includes Docker and Github repo existence and public visibility before Feb 18th, LICENSE file presence and Dockerfile existence; all are marked as passing (1). The table shows a breakdown (A1-A10, B1-B10, C1-C5) with all values as 0, the task score as 0, bonus as 1 and P1 score as 1. Attached docker and evaluation logs are offered to students who pass pre-requisites, with a caveat that only a docker log is given if the API service didn't start within 5 minutes., **[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image is an instructor's feedback on a student's Project 1 submission, providing a breakdown of the student's score and verification of pre-requisites. The feedback shows the final t-score calculation, GitHub and Docker repo links, and a pre-requisites check with passing marks (1) for each requirement (Docker/Github repo exists and is public, license file and Dockerfile exists). The student's task score is 0, bonus is 1, leading to a P1 score of 1, and the A/B/C matrix values are all zero, likely indicating tasks not successfully completed. The instructor mentions attached Docker and evaluation logs for students who passed the pre-requisites, clarifying that only a Docker log is available if the API service didn't start within 5 minutes. The message is an automated grading report, it is not from a specific instructor. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image shows the evaluation results for a student's TDS project 1 submission, including the final score calculation, repository links, and a breakdown of task scores and prerequisites. The final score is calculated as the minimum of 20 and the sum of the task score and bonus. The student's GitHub repository (https://github.com/veershah1231/tds_proj_1) and Docker repository (veershah1231/tdsproject1final) are listed, along with checks confirming the existence and public accessibility of both, and the presence of a LICENSE and Dockerfile in the GitHub repository. The student received a task score of 0 and a bonus of 1, resulting in a P1 score of 1; the tables provide further breakdown of the task score, with most elements marked as 0, indicating that those parts of the task weren't completed, and it notes that if their API service didn't start within 5 minutes, they would only receive a docker log. 2x" data-dominant-color="FAFAFA">image1455Ã—814 38 KB
