**[Discussion Image by Kabir1203]** This image shows a code snippet from the TDS student discussion thread focusing on the implementation of the `run_datagen` function in Python for an LLM-based automation agent project. The function extracts a URL and email address from a task description using regular expressions; if either is not found, it returns an error message. The code then downloads a script from the extracted URL using the `requests` library, saving it as "datagen.py" within the project root, and installs the `uv` package using pip if not already present. Finally, it executes the downloaded script using `subprocess`, passing the user's email as an argument, and returns a success message indicating the execution details.l address from the `task_description` using regular expressions. If either is missing, it returns an error message. It then downloads the script from the URL, saves it as "datagen.py" in the PROJECT_ROOT directory, and checks if the 'uv' package is installed; installing it using pip if 'uv' isn't found. Finally, the downloaded script is executed as a subprocess with the extracted email address as an argument using `subprocess.run`. The function returns a success message indicating the executed script and the email used. This is likely part of an LLM automation agent project, demonstrating how to dynamically download and execute code based on parsed information." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="4JNB76Nt2iFtCZpl6LVDjmNXXi9" width="690" height="466" data-dominant-color="232423">image1123Ã—760 42.8 KB
