## Data classification with Python

[**[Course Image: Data classification with Python]** This image shows a Python notebook snippet focused on data classification, specifically addressing outlier removal for a credit card decision tree model. The code utilizes the Interquartile Range (IQR) technique to identify and remove outliers from features like 'AMT_INCOME_TOTAL'. It first calculates the IQR for 'AMT_INCOME_TOTAL' using the 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles, then defines upper and lower bounds to filter data outside of this range. The image demonstrates how to apply these filters to remove outliers from the dataframe 'df', enhancing the quality of the dataset for subsequent model training; the df.shape output shows (6617, 37). This process is essential for improving model accuracy and preventing biased results due to extreme values in the dataset.aterial, the image illustrates the use of Python (specifically the pandas and seaborn libraries) to perform data cleaning by removing outliers from a dataset. It shows the process of identifying outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) technique, a method used to filter data points that fall significantly outside the normal range. This involves calculating the IQR and defining upper and lower bounds beyond which data points are considered outliers. The code snippet demonstrates how to filter the pandas DataFrame to exclude these outlier data points based on specified columns such as 'AMT_INCOME_TOTAL', and 'CNT_CHILDREN'. By learning to identify and remove outliers, students can improve the quality and reliability of their data analysis and machine learning models.)](https://youtu.be/XsOihX38Bg0)
