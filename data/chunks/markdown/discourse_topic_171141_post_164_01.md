**[Discussion Image by Jayeshbansal]** This image depicts an automated email received by a student in the TDS program regarding Project 1 prerequisite checks. The email outlines five requirements: a publicly accessible GitHub repository, an MIT license, a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image that runs with a specific podman command (`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`), and that the Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository. The email then presents the results of the prerequisite evaluations: the Docker image being present and public in Docker Hub failed, while the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license were found to be present and public. The overall result is that the prerequisites failed, leading to a project score of 0. This is a system generated communication to the students, not a human response in the discussion.erfile in the root of the github repo and MIT license in the root of github repo. As a result, the prerequisites check failed, and the project score is 0. The email directs the student to the TDS Project 1: Evaluation page for more details." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="5kcw1smiWWAisr8aFhSlEQWSU2p" width="396" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Jayeshbansal]** This image shows the automated feedback a student received regarding their Project 1 submission in the TDS program. The feedback email outlines the prerequisite checks, including GitHub repository accessibility, presence of a LICENSE file, a valid Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image that runs with a specific `podman run` command: `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`. The student's evaluation reveals that while their GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license are correctly set up, their Docker image is failing the "Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public" check, resulting in an overall "FAIL" for the prerequisites and a project score of 0. This likely indicates that the student has not successfully pushed their Docker image to Docker Hub or has not made it publicly accessible. The message urges the student to review the TDS Project 1 Evaluation page for detailed instructions., **[Discussion Image by Jayeshbansal]** This image shows an automated evaluation report for a student's Project 1 submission in the TDS course. The report details five prerequisite checks related to the student's GitHub repository and Docker image. The checks include the GitHub repository's existence and public accessibility, the presence of a LICENSE file with the MIT license, the existence of a valid Dockerfile, the public accessibility and runnable state of the Docker image via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`, and whether the Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository. The report indicates that while the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license pass the checks, the Docker image fails to be recognized as present and public on Docker Hub, resulting in an overall "FAIL" for the prerequisites and a Project 1 score of 0. Therefore, the student needs to address the Docker image visibility issue on Docker Hub to proceed. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Jayeshbansal]** This image shows the results of prerequisite evaluations for TDS Project 1, indicating a system-generated message to the student. It outlines five requirements: a public GitHub repo, a LICENSE file, a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image running via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`, and consistency between the Dockerfile in the repo and the Docker image. The evaluation results show that while the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license passed, the Docker image presence in DockerHub and its public accessibility failed. As a result, the overall prerequisites check failed, and the Project 1 score is 0, implying the submission will not be evaluated. 2x" data-dominant-color="EDEDED">image593Ã—747 61 KB
