## Nominatim API with Python

[**[Course Image: Nominatim Open Street Map with Python]** This section of the "Tools in Data Science" course, presented by instructor Anand S. and tutorial instructor Mahesh Balan U, focuses on retrieving data using the Nominatim API with Python, leveraging OpenStreetMap data. You will learn how to access and utilize geographical data from OpenStreetMap through the Nominatim API, enabling you to integrate location-based information into your data science projects. The objective is to equip students with the skills to fetch latitude and longitude coordinates or address details for a given location, using Python to interact with the API. By mastering this skill, you'll be able to incorporate geospatial data into your analysis and applications. A prerequisite is a basic understanding of Python programming and API concepts.geographic data using the Nominatim API with Python, leveraging Open Street Maps. It teaches you how to retrieve location information, such as latitude and longitude coordinates, from place names using Python. The course "Tools in Data Science" led by Instructor Anand S and Tutorial Instructor Mahesh Balan U, will guide you through the process of accessing and utilizing this API to extract data for various applications. By the end of this module, you'll be able to write Python code to query the Nominatim API and incorporate location data into your data science projects. This is essential for tasks like mapping, spatial analysis, and creating location-based services.)](https://youtu.be/f0PZ-pphAXE)

You'll learn how to get the latitude and longitude of any city from the Nominatim API.
