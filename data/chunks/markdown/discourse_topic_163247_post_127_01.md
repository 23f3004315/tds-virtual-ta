**[Discussion Image by 23ds1000022]** This image shows a student's code and error messages while working on TDS assignment GA3 related to Large Language Models, specifically on query parsing within a Python application, likely "GA3_Q8". The student's code in "main.py" includes a `parse_query` function with regular expressions for matching different query formats, such as scheduling meetings or checking expense balances. The error messages in the TERMINAL output indicate "Query format did not match any predefined patterns" and a "400 Bad Request" HTTP error when trying to execute the query "Arrange meeting 2025-12-17, 06:09, room: Conf1," suggesting an issue with the query's format not aligning with the regex patterns defined in the `parse_query` function, specifically around line 58. The student appears to be struggling with the formatting or logic of the regular expression intended to capture dates, times, and meeting room details from the query string, leading to the parsing failure and the "400 Bad Request" error, as well as a "404 Not Found" related to "POST /similarity HTTP/1.1". The error message includes details such as the IP address `127.0.0.1:60464` and the failing GET request, offering some debugging context; the IDE is VSCode.Conf1" but the current regex is failing to correctly identify and extract the relevant groups. This failure results in a 400 Bad Request error from the server, which the student is debugging within their Python virtual environment ("venv")." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-30 at 3.55.56 PM" data-base62-sha1="neBb1NrTfXruADuSrtrSuXa6aP9" width="690" height="431" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23ds1000022]** This image depicts a student's code and console output, showcasing debugging efforts in the "GA3 - Large Language Models" discussion thread. The student is working on a `parse_query` function in `main.py`, attempting to match different query formats using regular expressions, including a pattern for scheduling meetings. The console output displays error messages, specifically "Query format did not match any predefined patterns" and "400 Bad Request", indicating that the input query "Arrange meeting 2025-12-17, 06:09, room: Conf1" is not being correctly parsed by the regex. The student has included a debug print statement to inspect the matched groups. The presence of "404 Not Found" related to a "POST /similarity HTTP/1.1" suggests potential endpoint issues as well., **[Discussion Image by 23ds1000022]** The image depicts a student's code in `main.py` within the `GA3_Q8` project, specifically the `parse_query` function which uses regular expressions to match user queries like "Arrange meeting 2025-12-17, 06:09, room: Conf1". The student is encountering errors, as indicated by the "Query format did not match any predefined patterns" message in the terminal output, along with "400 Bad Request" errors from the server. The code tries to extract date, time and meeting room from the matched string, but the regex at line 58 is likely not matching the input query string correctly, preventing the successful parsing of the query. The errors suggest the student is facing issues with the regex pattern and how it's handling date and time formatting in the query string. The student is likely trying to debug why the regex isn't correctly capturing the expected information, resulting in the failure to parse the input query. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23ds1000022]** This image depicts a student debugging code within the TDS "GA3 - Large Language Models" discussion thread. The student is working on a `parse_query` function in `main.py`, attempting to extract information from a user query to schedule a meeting. The code uses regular expressions to match patterns like "Arrange meeting 2025-12-17, 06:09, room: Conf1". However, the terminal output shows "Query format did not match any predefined patterns" and "400 Bad Request" errors, indicating the student's input query is not being correctly parsed by the defined regular expression in the `re.match` function at line 58, `r"(?i)(arrange\s*meeting|schedule\s*a\s*meeting)\s*(?:on\s*)?(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}`. The student is likely struggling to correctly formulate the regex pattern to capture the date, time, and room details from the query string, and this is causing the function to return an error, resulting in a 400 error. 2x" data-dominant-color="EFF0F1">Screenshot 2025-01-30 at 3.55.56 PM1920Ã—1200 219 KB
