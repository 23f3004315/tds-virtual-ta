**[Discussion Image by 23f3002537]** This image captures a student's attempt to answer a FastAPI proxy server question during a TDS exam, as indicated by the exam interface, question details, and submission field. The question requires the student to create a proxy server that retrieves data from a given URL and adds a CORS header, with a specific example URL transformation provided. The student has entered `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` as their endpoint, which is flagged as an "Incorrect response." On the right, the student is using Thunder Client to test their API, showing successful 200 OK responses for some requests but also a 422 Unprocessable Entity error for another URL, `http://127.0.0.1:51266` suggesting a potential issue with URL encoding or the server's handling of the request, and a 200 OK response for the request to example.com URL, confirming the server's basic proxy functionality is working./api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%3Fkey%3Dvalue`. The response from example.com is displayed in the Thunder Client's response window, showing a successful 200 OK status and the HTML content of the example domain. In the Terminal, the student can see the Thunder Client's HTTP requests with different URL's to try to solve the question." alt="Screenshot (92)" data-base62-sha1="nCVhmhSv09DbgOHi9ZI8O75Xh41" width="690" height="388" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f3002537]** This image depicts a student working on a TDS exam question requiring them to write a FastAPI proxy server. The question asks for a server that serves data from a given URL and adds a CORS header, providing an example request and expected behavior using `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. The student has entered `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` as the FastAPI Proxy URL endpoint, but the system shows "Error: Incorrect response". The student is using Thunder Client to test their API, making requests to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%` and getting a 200 OK response with HTML content from `example.com`. The student needs to ensure the proxy correctly fetches and returns the data with the added CORS header for the assessment to pass., **[Discussion Image by 23f3002537]** This image shows a student's attempt to answer a question on a remote online exam, specifically question 1, which asks the student to write a FastAPI proxy server. The question provides an example: requesting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%3Fkey%3Dvalue` should return data from `https://example.com/?key=value` with a CORS header. The student inputs `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` as their FastAPI Proxy URL endpoint, but the system returns an "Error: Incorrect response". On the right, the student uses Thunder Client to test their solution, sending a GET request to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%` which returns a 200 OK status, showing the HTML of the example.com domain, logged in the Terminal as a "200 OK" response. The student seems to be struggling with the URL encoding or the logic required to extract the URL from the query parameter and fetch the original URL's content, potentially causing the proxy server to not function as intended. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f3002537]** This image captures a student's attempt to answer a coding question on a remote online exam, specifically question #1 which involves writing a FastAPI proxy server. The problem states the server needs to fetch data from a given URL and include a CORS header. The student provides `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` as their FastAPI proxy URL endpoint but receives an "Error: Incorrect response". The question details that the test will evaluate the submission by sending a request with `?url=...` to verify the data matches. The right-hand side of the screen shows the Thunder Client, with a GET request made to the specified endpoint, including the URL as a query parameter (url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%). The Thunder Client response shows a status code of 200 OK, and the response body displays the HTML content of `example.com`, indicating the proxy server is functioning and returning the correct data. However, the terminal shows the original attempt resulted in a 422 Unprocessable Entity error, suggesting an issue with an earlier request. The core confusion is the discrepancy between the successful data retrieval in Thunder Client and the "Incorrect response" error shown within the exam interface. 2x" data-dominant-color="1E2424">Screenshot (92)1920Ã—1080 352 KB
