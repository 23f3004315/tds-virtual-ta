@carlton @Jivraj

Sir,

This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 82aeb74ca739 ,

but i had never provided this docker image instead my image id is de8235663462

then how it get evaluated, also none of the docker image created by me has this id. My docker image was created on linux/amd64.

Please, look over it @carlton , @Jivraj .

Regards,
