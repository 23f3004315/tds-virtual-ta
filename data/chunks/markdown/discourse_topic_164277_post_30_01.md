**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image displays a list of deliverables for a project, providing guidance for students and setting expectations. It outlines tasks such as creating a public GitHub repository, adding an MIT license file, writing and testing code using POST and GET requests, creating a Dockerfile, publishing the Docker image to Docker Hub, and running the image via `podman`. The `podman` command includes environment variables and port mapping, ensuring the API serves at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`. A key deliverable highlighted in a red box is submitting the GitHub repository URL and Docker image name via a Google Form, with placeholders given as examples: `https://github.com/user-name/repo-name` and `user-name/repo-name`. The image provides instruction, similar to an instructor's post guiding students toward the required project components.information aims to clarify the submission requirements and expected setup. The red box emphasizes the Google Form submission step." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-29 at 8.19.05 am" data-base62-sha1="7GRWQ9A0Ygc4UgcaxkNn2rTuJyx" width="690" height="389" srcset="**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image from the "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent - Discussion Thread" shows part of the project deliverables. The instructions detail the need to create a public GitHub repository with an MIT LICENSE, write and test code by calling POST `/run?task=...` and GET `/read?path=...` endpoints, create a Dockerfile, and publish the Docker image to Docker Hub. Specifically, the instructions clarify how to ensure the image is running using `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000` such that the API is accessible at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`. The last item, highlighted by a red border, instructs students to submit the URL of their GitHub repository (with an example like `https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`) and their Docker image name (like `user-name/repo-name`) through a Google Form. This likely sets the context for student questions in the discussion thread, concerning the steps required for project completion and the correct format for submission., **[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image shows a slide from the TDS project 1 assignment, outlining the deliverables for the LLM-based automation agent project, it's likely from an instructor. It lists tasks like creating a public GitHub repository, adding an MIT License, writing and testing code with POST/run and GET/read endpoints, committing and pushing code, creating a Dockerfile, and publishing the Docker image to Docker Hub. It specifies using `podman run` with environment variables and port mapping to serve the API. Finally, it instructs students to submit the GitHub repository URL and Docker image name in a Google Form, providing example formats for both as `https://github.com/user-name/repo-name` and `user-name/repo-name` respectively, these are highlighted in a red box. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image presents the "Deliverables" section of the Project 1 assignment in the TDS Jan 2025 course, specifically relating to an LLM-based automation agent. The list outlines steps including creating a public GitHub repository with an MIT LICENSE, writing and testing code with POST and GET requests, committing and pushing code, creating a Dockerfile, publishing the Docker image to Docker Hub, and ensuring the image runs correctly using a `podman run` command with environment variables and port mapping. The student is instructed to test that calls to `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...` work as expected. Finally, the deliverables are submitted in a Google Form, including the GitHub repository URL (`https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`) and the Docker image name (`user-name/repo-name`), both using the correct format. This is a set of instructions from the instructor to the students for project submission. 2x" data-dominant-color="F3F2F1">Screenshot 2025-01-29 at 8.19.05 am1738Ã—982 122 KB
