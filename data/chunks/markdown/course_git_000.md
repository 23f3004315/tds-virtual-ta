## Version Control: Git, GitHub

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the de facto standard for version control of software (and sometimes, data as well). It's a system that keeps track of changes you make to files and folders. It allows you to revert to a previous state, compare changes, etc. It's a central tool in any developer's workflow.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is the most popular hosting service for Git repositories. It's a website that shows your code, allows you to collaborate with others, and provides many useful tools for developers.

[**[Course Image: Git Tutorial for Beginners: Command-Line Fundamentals (30 min)]** This resource focuses on "git" fundamentals using the command-line interface, a critical skill for developers. Mastering command-line "git" enables you to execute essential version control tasks directly through your terminal. Understanding the command-line is foundational because most GUI tools ultimately translate actions into command-line "git" operations. Learning these fundamentals provides a deeper understanding of "git" and allows for greater control over your version control workflow. This knowledge is essential for effective collaboration and code management in TDS projects.nd-line fundamentals, essential for version control in software development and collaborative projects. The focus is on mastering basic Git commands directly through the terminal or command prompt. Learning outcomes include understanding Git's core concepts, such as repositories, commits, and branches, and using command-line tools to initialize, track, and manage changes in a project. This knowledge builds a strong foundation for more advanced Git operations and is directly applicable in TDS projects where version control and collaboration are crucial. Familiarity with basic command-line operations is a prerequisite.)](https://youtu.be/HVsySz-h9r4)
