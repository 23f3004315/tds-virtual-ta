**[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image depicts a student's troubleshooting process within the TDS Solver project, specifically concerning the display of API documentation using Swagger UI. The student is using Postman to send a GET request to `http://localhost:8000/api` and observes the response in HTML format. The HTML body contains the Swagger UI setup, including a script tag referencing the Swagger UI bundle from a CDN and a script initializing SwaggerUIBundle with the OpenAPI specification URL set to `/openapi.json` and configuration options for the UI. The status code is 200 OK, indicating the server responded successfully, although it's not clear if Swagger UI is rendering as intended based on just this information. This is an attempt to view and debug the API documentation.he UI should be rendered. The status code is 200 OK, indicating a successful HTTP request. This most likely reflects part of the student's troubleshooting process, trying to display Swagger documentation for the API." alt="get" data-base62-sha1="swUI2YjkM4AXcq3PHxUZM7Ginwp" width="690" height="466" srcset="**[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image shows a student's attempt to use Postman to access the Swagger UI documentation endpoint of their TDS (presumably Traffic Demand Simulation) project. The student is making a GET request to `http://localhost:8000/api`. The response body, displayed as HTML, includes the necessary HTML and JavaScript to render the Swagger UI. Specifically, it includes a script tag that loads the Swagger UI bundle from a CDN and initializes Swagger UI using `SwaggerUIBundle` with the `openapi.json` URL and configurations for the DOM ID and layout. The response status is "200 OK", indicating the request was successful. The student is likely trying to confirm the Swagger UI is set up correctly for their API documentation., **[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image depicts a student using Postman to interact with an API endpoint. The student is making a GET request to `http://localhost:8000/api`, and the response body is displayed. The response includes HTML content containing Swagger UI elements, suggesting the API documentation is being served. Key elements include `` and a script tag referencing the Swagger UI bundle from a CDN: ``. Also shown is JavaScript code initializing Swagger UI with `SwaggerUIBundle` and configuring the `url` to `/openapi.json`, the `dom_id` to `#swagger-ui`, and the `layout` to `BaseLayout`. The HTTP status is 200 OK. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image depicts a student using Postman to interact with an API, specifically exploring the Swagger UI documentation. The student has sent a GET request to `http://localhost:8000/api` and is viewing the HTML response in the "Body" section, selecting the "Pretty" view for better readability. The HTML code includes a script that loads the SwaggerUIBundle from a CDN and initializes it, pointing to `/openapi.json` as the URL for the API definition. The status code is 200 OK, indicating that the request was successful. The student is likely inspecting the HTML source to understand how the Swagger UI is being rendered and configured, possibly as part of debugging or learning how to implement it. 2x" data-dominant-color="212222">get1525Ã—1030 38.6 KB
