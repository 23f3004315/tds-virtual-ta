**[Discussion Image by karthiksirimilla]** This image captures a student's troubleshooting process during a TDS project, specifically dealing with the 'uvx datasette' task. The student is facing errors related to reading files 'b9.html' and 'b10.csv', as indicated by "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found" and "B9 failed: Cannot read /data/b9.html" or "B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv". A "HTTP 400 Bad Request" error along with a "Connection refused" error suggests issues in connecting to the datasette server running on localhost:8001, potentially due to incorrect SQL query formatting or the server not being properly started. The score of 6/20 implies partial completion or success in other aspects of the assignment, with the final HTTP request to 'aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev' returning a successful "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" response. This looks like a peer discussion where the student is detailing the error and the technical content associated with it, trying to get a possible solution for it.ail and the subsequent attempt to read `/data/b10.csv` to result in another 404. The final HTTP Request to OpenAI's embedding service returned a "HTTP/1.1 200 OK", indicating success with that API call, but the overall score is low at 6/20 due to issues with datasette execution." alt="IMG_6418" data-base62-sha1="vfZJp9E32S2QSOkawO36N5d1048" width="246" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by karthiksirimilla]** The image shows a student's attempt to run a datasette task within the UVX environment for a project, encountering several errors. The task involves counting the number of rows in `ticket-sales.csv` where the type is "Bronze," saving the result to `/data/b10.csv`, and then stopping the datasette server. The student receives "HTTP 404 Not Found" errors when trying to read `/data/b9.html` and `/data/b10.csv`, indicating that these files are not found at the specified paths. Additionally, an "HTTP 400 Bad Request" error arises, accompanied by a "Connection refused" error, suggesting that the datasette server running on localhost:8001 is either not running or unreachable, causing issues with accessing the `ticket-sales.csv` file. The student's score is 6/20, indicating significant issues with the task., **[Discussion Image by karthiksirimilla]** This image captures a student's error logs and system outputs during an assignment. The errors include "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found" for accessing 'data/b9.html' and 'data/b10.csv', indicating the files are not found at the specified localhost address. Additionally, a "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request" error occurs during a POST request, which is attributed to "Connection refused" and "Max retries exceeded" when trying to connect to localhost on port 8001, likely due to the datasette server not running or not being accessible. The screenshot shows commands to run 'uvx datasette' on 'ticket-sales.db' on port 8001, query for rows with type "Bronze", and save the result to '/data/b10.csv', indicating the task involves running a local database server, querying it, and saving the results. The student's current score is 6/20, signaling that the task has not been completed successfully due to the errors. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by karthiksirimilla]** This image captures a student's troubleshooting process during the TDS project, showcasing a series of failed attempts and error messages. The student is running a datasette to count the number of rows in the "tickets" table where the "type" is "Bronze," saving the output to "/data/b10.csv." Errors include "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found" for "/data/b9.html" and "/data/b10.csv," "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request," and "Connection refused," suggesting issues with the datasette server or URL construction. The student's B9 and B10 tasks failed, resulting in a low score of 6/20, indicating difficulty reading the created data file, likely due to the datasette server not running correctly or connection problems. 2x" data-dominant-color="151515">IMG_64181290Ã—2619 566 KB
