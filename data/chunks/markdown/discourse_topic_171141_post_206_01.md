 @Carlton I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted.

***However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29.***

**[Discussion Image by thinkmachine]** This image from a TDS student discussion provides links and descriptions of various files related to a project submission, including evaluation and docker logs, server start log files, evaluation scripts, data generation files, and docker orchestration files. Specifically, it provides Google Drive links to the Evaluation Log file and the Docker Log file, noting the former contains the student's performance report and the latter details the technical performance of the Docker container. Files for items 3-7, such as the Server start log file, evaluation script file, data generation file, Docker orchestration file, and solution script, are provided as attachments, potentially due to size or format. The image concludes by listing the ID of the Docker image that was evaluated: 11aa22fc1545. This information guides students to understand the evaluation process and access relevant data for debugging and review, which could resolve confusion about how their submission was assessed.ks to the Evaluation log file and Docker log file on Google Drive, containing performance reports and technical performance data, respectively. Additionally, it mentions Server start log file, Evaluation script file, Data generation file, Docker orchestration file, and Solution script (zip) as attachments, detailing their purpose such as testing scripts, data handling, Docker image retrieval and setup, and a sample solution using prompt engineering. The post also specifies the Docker image ID used for evaluation: 11aa22fc1545. Students can use this information to troubleshoot issues, understand the evaluation process, and potentially leverage the solution script for guidance." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="m5oZT6ccNhYAMcg96GqKgDnNOWO" width="690" height="214" data-dominant-color="EEEFF1">image1272Ã—395 25.7 KB
