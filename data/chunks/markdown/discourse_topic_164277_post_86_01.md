**[Discussion Image by 22f2001640]** This image shows an error message encountered by a student during the TDS Jan 2025 LLM-based Automation Agent project. The message indicates an "API Error: 429," which is typically a rate limiting error. Specifically, the error message explains that on February 2025, the student's usage of the API exceeded the allowed limit of $2, with an actual usage of $2.002295600000011. This is likely a student question related to API usage limits within the project's constraints, where they exceeded their budget. The resolution involves understanding and adhering to the API's usage limits, potentially optimizing code to reduce API calls or increasing the allocated budget.lly, the student exceeded a $2.00 usage limit on February 2025, having consumed $2.002295600000011. This is a student question, illustrating an error a student has run into during project execution, specifically related to exceeding an API usage quota. It's likely that the student will ask for guidance on how to manage or work around this limitation to continue with the project." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="h1TDysFxS8sSBnC3Yk9Z4t6w7u1" width="690" height="25" data-dominant-color="303030">

Kindly help me to resolve this issue. I am unable to proceed with my project.
