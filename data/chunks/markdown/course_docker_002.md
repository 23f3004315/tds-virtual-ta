[**[Course Image: Learn Docker in 7 Easy Steps - Full Beginner's Tutorial]** This image introduces the concept of "Dockerizing" an application, specifically using Node.js, and outlines a process to achieve this in seven steps. Dockerizing refers to the process of packaging an application and its dependencies into a Docker container, ensuring it can run consistently across different environments. The primary learning outcome is to understand how to containerize a Node.js application for portability and reproducibility. This fits into the broader Docker curriculum by demonstrating a practical application of Docker concepts. Prerequisites for understanding this content include a basic familiarity with Docker concepts and Node.js development.of "Dockerizing" an application, specifically focusing on doing so with a Node.js application. The key takeaway is that the process can be broken down into seven manageable steps. Dockerizing allows you to package your application with all its dependencies into a container. This ensures consistency across different environments, simplifies deployment, and promotes portability. You will learn how to create a Dockerfile, build the image, and run the container, enabling you to deploy Node.js apps reliably.)](https://youtu.be/gAkwW2tuIqE)
