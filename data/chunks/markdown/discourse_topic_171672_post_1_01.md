**[Discussion Image by virajpitale]** This image shows feedback for a student's Project 1 submission, detailing the required prerequisites and their evaluation. The feedback lists five requirements, including having a public GitHub repository, an MIT license file, a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image that can run via a specific `podman run` command, and that the Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository. The evaluation shows that the Docker image and GitHub repository passed the public accessibility checks and the Dockerfile was present; however, the MIT license file check failed. Consequently, the overall prerequisites are marked as "FAIL", resulting in a Project 1 score of 0, indicating the submission will not be evaluated until these are resolved. The student needs to add an MIT license at the root of their Github repository.T license, a valid Dockerfile, public Docker image accessibility and runnable via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`, and using the same Dockerfile. The email indicates that the student's GitHub repository and Docker image are present and public and that Dockerfile is in root. The automated evaluation shows that the student failed the "MIT license present at root of github repo" check, resulting in a "Prerequisites: FAIL" and a Project 1 Score of 0. This implies the student needs to add an MIT license file to the root of their GitHub repository to pass the check." alt="Screenshot 2025-04-03 161302" data-base62-sha1="vzyGKXNJLbjCYVCKBk7si2XdJ6S" width="689" height="290" data-dominant-color="F7F7F7">Screenshot 2025-04-03 1613021268Ã—533 16.3 KB
