## Actor Network Visualization

Find the shortest path between Govinda & Angelina Jolie using IMDb data using Python: [networkx](https://pypi.org/project/networkx/) or [scikit-network](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-network).

[**[Course Image: Jolie No. 1]** This image uses a popular news story about an actor declining a role in the movie "Avatar" to illustrate the concept of actors in actor-network theory. In this context, "actors" aren't limited to humans but encompass any entity that can influence or be influenced within a network. The actor's decision and the claims associated with the movie's title can be visualized as nodes and connections within a network, mapping relationships and influences. This humorous example helps to demystify the abstract concept of "actors" beyond just people when constructing network visualizations. Therefore, students can learn to identify and map diverse actors and their relationships when analyzing complex systems. of actors (in this case, a Bollywood actor Govinda) potentially being part of a network related to a project (the movie "Avatar"). The image highlights the complex relationships and claims (Govinda suggesting the title) that can exist within such a network. While seemingly humorous, it underscores that even individuals not directly involved in the final product can influence or be connected to a project's development, demonstrating how actor-network-visualization could map these unexpected relationships. This reinforces the idea that networks can be complex and may involve actors with varying degrees of influence and connection, moving beyond simple collaborations to include indirect contributions or even just claims of involvement. Understanding this helps visualize how seemingly disparate elements can form a network.)](https://youtu.be/lcwMsPxPIjc)
