Dear Learner

Please access the Mock ROE 2 at this link:

exam.sanand.workers.dev

Technical Assessment

There is no time limit for this Mock. The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it.

After the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE).

To check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console.

`inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
textboxes = document.querySelectorAll("textarea")
buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button")
inputs.forEach(input =&gt; input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
buttons.forEach(input =&gt; input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
textboxes.forEach(input =&gt; input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
`
Do not submit or save your answers.

All the best!

Kind regards

TDS Team
