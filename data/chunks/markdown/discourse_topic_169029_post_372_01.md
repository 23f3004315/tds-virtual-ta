**[Discussion Image by 23f2000599]** This image depicts a student using Postman to interact with the TDS Solver API, showing a student question and the server's response. The student sends a POST request to the `/api` endpoint with a form-data parameter named "question" and the value "what is output of -s?". The response body, formatted as JSON, includes an "answer" field, however, the content appears to be system information such as the OS version, CPU details, memory, and GPU status instead of the answer to the question. The response status is "200 OK", indicating a successful HTTP request, but the API returned system information which is likely unintended, reflecting a possible issue with the TDS Solver logic not parsing the command correctly. The screenshot shows Postman tabs like Params, Authorization, Headers, Body, Scripts, and Settings, with the Body tab actively displayed containing the query and JSON response.ils about GPU, rendering, and rasterization settings. The detailed response includes data which seems like debugging information as it does not directly answer the question asked by the student." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="NeKyqBhaRuc0JiSb10ts0LwOVN" width="690" height="389" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2000599]** This image illustrates a student's interaction with a TDS solver API through a tool like Postman. The student is sending a POST request to the endpoint `4.213.61.248:8080/api` with the `Content-Type` set to `form-data`, and the body of the request contains a key-value pair: `question` is the key and "what is output of -s?" is the value. The tool returns a `200 OK` status code, indicating a successful request, and the JSON response includes an "answer" field containing system information such as OS version, CPU, GPU, and rendering capabilities. This indicates a peer discussion where one student is testing the API by asking a question, the API is functioning correctly., **[Discussion Image by 23f2000599]** The image depicts a student's question regarding the output of "-s" within the context of the TDS solver project, submitted via a POST request in a tool like Postman or Insomnia. The request is sent to the endpoint `4.213.61.248:8080/api` with the question "what is output of -s?" included as form data under the key "question". The server responds with a 200 OK status, and the JSON body contains the "answer" key holding a string with various system and software information, including versions, memory, CPU details, and rendering configurations which seems to describe the properties of the remote execution environment. The student is likely trying to understand a specific aspect of the system's behavior when using the "-s" option. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2000599]** This image shows a student using Postman to interact with an API endpoint, likely part of the TDS Solver project. The student is sending a POST request to the address `4.213.61.248:8080/api` with the "question" key set to "what is output of -s?". The student selected the "x-www-form-urlencoded" option to send this key-value pair. The response received from the API is a JSON object, which is displayed in the body and contains an "answer" field providing version and system status information, including details about the Darwin arm64 operating system, CPU, memory, GPU compositing, and rasterization settings. The student is testing the server's response to a specific input as part of the project, likely to understand the behavior or debug the TDS solver. 2x" data-dominant-color="262625">image1337Ã—754 55.1 KB
