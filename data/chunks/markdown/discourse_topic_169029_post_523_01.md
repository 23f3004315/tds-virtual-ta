**[Discussion Image by bhavanagv]** This image depicts a student's interaction with a TDS solver interface, showing the process of submitting a question via a POST request to the backend. The student inputs a question related to Google Sheets formulas: "Let's make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won't work in Excel) =SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 9, 11), 1, 10)) What is the." The interface shows the curl command used to make the request, including the URL, headers, and the question parameter. The server response indicates a successful HTTP 200 code and provides a response body containing "answer": 585, implying the TDS solver correctly evaluated the Google Sheets formula. This indicates a successful round trip and potential learning for the student regarding formula evaluation within the TDS context.ent can download the response as well." alt="Screenshot 2025-04-15 153625" data-base62-sha1="bPiciPc9a8A02ZNqDyJr3iQwKN1" width="690" height="322" srcset="**[Discussion Image by bhavanagv]** This image depicts a student interacting with the TDS Solver interface in a discussion thread. The student is trying to submit a Google Sheets formula, specifically `SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 9, 11), 1, 10))` as the "question" via a POST request to the specified Azure cloud app URL. The screenshot shows the cURL command used, and the "Server Response" indicates a successful execution (code 200) with the calculated answer "585" returned in the response body as a JSON object. This suggests the student is verifying the functionality of the solver with a formula., **[Discussion Image by bhavanagv]** This image captures a student's interaction with the TDS solver interface, specifically demonstrating how to pose a question related to Google Sheets formulas. The student enters the question "Let's make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won't work in Excel) =SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 9, 11), 1, 10)) What is th," through the provided text input field. After executing the request, the system returns a successful HTTP 200 response with the answer 585 in JSON format. The image also shows the constructed cURL command and the request URL used to query the solver, demonstrating the underlying API call. This showcases a successful test case for evaluating Google Sheets formula processing within the TDS solver. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by bhavanagv]** This image depicts a student's interaction with a TDS solver tool while working on Project 2, specifically within the "Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread". The student is inputting a question: "Let's make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won't work in Excel) =SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 9, 11), 1, 10)) What is the sum?" into a text field labeled "question". After clicking the "Execute" button, the response shows a successful HTTP 200 status code, and the "Response body" contains a JSON object with the key "answer" and value "585", indicating the solver successfully calculated the result of the formula. The image also provides the `curl` command used to make the API request, detailing the POST request, headers, and form data sent to the solver API endpoint. 2x" data-dominant-color="BFC9C7">Screenshot 2025-04-15 1536251917Ã—895 42.7 KB
