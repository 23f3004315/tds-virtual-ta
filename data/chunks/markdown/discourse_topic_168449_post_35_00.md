Q: You are the operations manager for World Courier. You are trying to find the shortest path between `Doha` and `Muscat`.

World Courier has a fleet of aircraft that can fly directly between specific cities. The distance between two cities is the Haversine distance.

What is the sequence of cities that you should fly to minimize the total distance traveled?

Write the answer as a sequence of cities separated by commas.
