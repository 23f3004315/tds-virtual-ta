## Post #493 by 22f3000819

When I run my docker image using

`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

Task A2 fails as the podman container is unable to find npx.

Running the same image using

`docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

works fine and Task A2 passes. I canâ€™t understand why this is happening.

I also ran the image in both docker and podman in interactive mode as show in the below snippet from terminal.

When run using docker, `which node` gives `/usr/bin/node` as output but when run using podman, nothing.
