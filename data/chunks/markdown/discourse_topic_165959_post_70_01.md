 to crack this , I tired multiple time no improvement.

Also what does this " It is *very hard* to get the correct Markdown output from a PDF. Any method you use will likely require manual corrections. Reformatting with Prettier helps standardize the output format for comparison." mean.

**[Discussion Image by 22f2001640]** This image shows a student attempting the "q-pdf-to-markdown" exercise in the TDS (The Data Science) course, specifically the GA4 module. The task involves converting a PDF to Markdown format using Prettier version 3.4.2. The image displays the student's attempted Markdown conversion of sample text from the PDF and reveals an "Incorrect. Try again." message due to formatting errors, indicated by red highlighting. An instructor tip beneath states it is difficult to get correct Markdown output from a PDF and requires manual corrections, emphasizing the role of Prettier in standardizing the output. The student is likely facing difficulties accurately representing the PDF's content in Markdown using Prettier's specified version, leading to the validation failure and a point of confusion regarding proper PDF-to-Markdown conversion.in." The exercise instructions include converting a PDF to Markdown, formatting with Prettier, and then submitting the result. The input box shows the student's Markdown rendition of a sample PDF, including text like "Ater vulnero solio tabula" and "Talio balbus cultura vae," with underlined sections in red indicating potential errors. The post text notes that achieving correct Markdown output from PDFs is challenging, often requiring manual corrections, and that Prettier is helpful for standardizing the output format for comparison. Therefore, this is a student attempting a task and receiving immediate feedback on its accuracy." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="icZrlKl047gJ4Ht07fQW4AR9MGr" width="690" height="386" data-dominant-color="2A2D31">image1327Ã—743 41.6 KB
