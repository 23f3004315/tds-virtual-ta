In GA-2 Q6, Q9 and Q10 answers are not getting accepted on my device(Mac book air) but when I am executing the same thing from my friends device(windows 11 pro) it is getting accepted and then when I try to save it from her device and then do the final submission from my my device then again the answers are not getting submitted for the same three questions.

@s.anand Sir please help me through this
