**[Discussion Image by 23f2000098]** This image shows a student question within a TDS student discussion thread regarding GA4 data sourcing. The student is working on an API development task, specifically creating an API endpoint to fetch and parse Wikipedia content, converting headings into a Markdown outline, and enabling CORS. The student asks "What is the URL of your API endpoint?" and provides the URL "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/outline?country=france" which results in the error message "TypeError: Failed to fetch." This indicates a problem with the API endpoint or the request being made to it, likely related to the server not running, CORS issues, or an incorrect URL path. The discussion is focused on troubleshooting this error and getting the API endpoint to function correctly.PI to extract Wikipedia content and generate a markdown outline, using FastAPI. The student asks "What is the URL of your API endpoint?" and provides the URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/outline?country=france`. An error message "TypeError: Failed to fetch" is displayed, indicating a potential issue with accessing the API endpoint, potentially related to CORS or the API server not running. This highlights a troubleshooting step and a student's difficulty in correctly accessing the API endpoint they've built based on the prior instructions." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="y7s71VjnkZqo7VUQOVSywz3kH0g" width="690" height="304" data-dominant-color="999A9D">image1224Ã—540 18.9 KB
