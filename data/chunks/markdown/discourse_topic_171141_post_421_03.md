**[Discussion Image by 22f3002902]** This image depicts a student running the `run.py` file for the `Em-automation-agent` project in VS Code, revealing the project's directory structure on the left sidebar and the code within `run.py` in the editor. The terminal output shows the Flask development server starting, listening on various IP addresses (including 127.0.0.1 and 0.0.0.0), and handling POST requests to endpoints like `/Method/postBankAccountWithdrawMonday.json` and `/Method/postBankAccountWithdrawWednesday.json`, indicating successful processing with a "success" status. In a separate browser window, the GitHub repository for the `Em-automation-agent` project is displayed, listing the project's files and directories such as `BACKEND`, `DATA`, `DOCS`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `run.py`, `SECURITY.md`, `services.sh`, and `config.py`, confirming that the local code aligns with the remote repository. This indicates the student is likely testing or running the automation agent after cloning or downloading it from GitHub, with the Flask server managing the request handling.execution of the `automation-agent` script." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="e6XLFjN5PrQqC90ksjTjrlFdGPW" width="255" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f3002902]** This image shows a student's screen displaying a VS Code IDE and a GitHub repository, indicating a question or troubleshooting step related to a coding project. The VS Code window contains `api.py` and `main.py` code, with `python run.py` being executed in the terminal, triggering a Flask development server that outputs log messages, including "Detected credit card number" and "Unsupported offer." The terminal also displays successful POST requests with 200 status codes. The Github repository, named "rim-automation-agent," contains files and folders such as `data`, `docs`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `rim.py`, `server.py` and more, suggesting the student is working with a Flask-based application interacting with credit card data. The successful POST requests indicate at least partial functionality, but the "Unsupported offer" message and credit card detection hint at possible issues or areas for further development or debugging., **[Discussion Image by 22f3002902]** This image captures a student's coding environment, showing a potential issue with their LLM Automation Agent project code within Visual Studio Code, alongside their GitHub repository. The student is running a Python Flask application ("python run.py"), which appears to be serving endpoints on localhost:8000, as indicated by the console output "Serving Flask app 'app.main'". A curl command is executed in the terminal, POSTing data to "http://localhost:8000/runTask=count%20wednesdays", which returns a successful message indicating that the number of Wednesdays in the "data\dates.txt" file was successfully counted. The GitHub repository, named "llm-automation-agent," is displayed in the browser, showing files like "main.py", "run.py", and "requirements.txt," indicating that the project files are pushed to GitHub. This suggests a peer discussion or a student showcasing a successfully running application after addressing earlier discrepancies, possibly related to endpoint configuration or data processing. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f3002902]** The image shows a student debugging their LLM Automation Agent project. The student's Visual Studio Code editor displays the project's file structure, including `main.py`, `run.py`, and `requirements.txt`. The `run.py` file is open, revealing the Flask application setup with routes for `/` and `/read`. The terminal output shows the Flask app running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, and `curl` command used to send a POST request to the `/run` endpoint with the task "count wednesdays". The response indicates the task was successful, with a message stating that 30 Wednesdays were counted in the `data\\dates.txt` file. Additionally, the student's GitHub repository, `llm-automation-agent`, is visible in a browser window, showing the project structure and recent commits. The student seems to have successfully executed a task using their Flask application and has also committed their project to GitHub. 2x" data-dominant-color="1D1F21">image1440Ã—2823 252 KB
