Here’s how to prompt folks. Just do what @carlton mentioned in today’s live session (the 5 hour marathon) and you should be good for Project-1!

**[Discussion Image by 23f1003186]** The image shows a profile picture of a TDS student, 23f1003186, posting in the "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]". As the sole element, the image lacks specific technical content or discussion details beyond indicating a student contribution to the project discussion thread. Thus, it is impossible to determine the question, answer, troubleshooting, or confusion aspects of the project based on just the user's avatar. Future images of the thread's content would be needed to analyze the problem-solving context.icates that the discussion thread contains student questions, instructor answers, and peer discussions about the LLM project. The specific post (#494) will likely contain a technical question or contribution related to the project, and the user's profile image is used to identify them within the forum. The image context is that of a TDS course discussion board with student and instructor interaction. This image alone doesn't provide technical context beyond the user posting to a discussion thread, but implies project-related troubleshooting or guidance exists." class="thumbnail onebox-avatar" data-dominant-color="7A7879" width="48" height="48">
