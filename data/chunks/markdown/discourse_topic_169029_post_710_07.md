**[Discussion Image by 23f2004837]** The image depicts a student's attempt to submit their GitHub Pages URL for the TDS solver project, evidenced by the prompt "What is the GitHub Pages URL?".

An instructor tip suggests appending `?v=1` or `?v=2` to the URL to bypass cache issues if recent changes are not reflected. The Chrome DevTools Sources panel is open, showing `exam.js`, `exam-tds-2025-01-ga2.js`, `fetch.js`, and `index.js` files, with highlighted code snippets showing a fetch request to "https://23f2004837.github.io/" and logic for handling incorrect submissions.atch error, sets variable R to "Incorrect.

The student has entered "https://23f2004837.github.io/" as their URL, and the system is currently "Checking...". The image also shows a hint to bust the cache by adding "?v=1, ?v=2" to the URL if changes are not reflected. The developer console's "Sources" tab shows the student is inspecting Javascript files, likely to debug why the submission isn't working, and the code snippets in "exam.js" and "exam-tds-2025-01-ga2.js" show the student's url as a parameter to the "f" variable. It appears the student is troubleshooting why their submitted URL is not being correctly validated or processed by the system, prompting them to examine the underlying JavaScript code., **[Discussion Image by 23f2004837]** This image captures a student's attempt to submit their GitHub Pages URL for the TDS solver project, reflecting a student question being addressed by the system's automated checks. The student inputs "https://23f2004837.github.io/" into the provided field, and the system responds with "Checking..." while validating. A helpful tip advises adding "?v=1" or "?v=2" to the URL to bypass cache issues if recent changes are not reflected. By inspecting the "Sources" tab in the Chrome DevTools, specifically within exam-tds-2025-01-ga2.js, it reveals code responsible for fetching and validating the URL, using an asynchronous function and checking if the returned value is true, otherwise displaying an "Incorrect. Try again." message. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2004837]** This image depicts a student entering their GitHub Pages URL (https://23f2004837.github.io/) into a field on the TDS solver project and the system is checking it. A note indicates that if recent changes aren't showing, the user should add "?v=1" or "?v=2" to the URL to bypass the cache. The Chrome DevTools panel is open on the "Sources" tab, showing the `exam.js` file and highlighting a line containing the URL "https://23f2004837.github.io/". The code snippet shows a try-catch block where, if the URL check fails, the response `R` is set to "Incorrect. Try again." This indicates the student is likely troubleshooting why their URL isn't being accepted, and the DevTools show the JavaScript code responsible for validating the URL. 2x" data-dominant-color="C9C9C8">image2432Ã—846 224 KB
