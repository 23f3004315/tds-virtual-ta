**[Discussion Image by 21f3002647]** This image shows a project submission by student "arnavmehta2025" titled "llm_project1", which is at the center of a TDS student discussion where the project was marked as "FAIL" despite having a Dockerfile and image. The image shows the repository name as "arnavmehta2025/llm_project1," the author, the update time as "2 days ago", and indicates that it's an "IMAGE". It also displays the number of stars (0) and downloads (16). The student is likely confused about the failing grade because they believed the existence of the Dockerfile and a built image should have been sufficient for passing. The discussion seeks to clarify the expectations and requirements for project validation beyond simply providing a Dockerfile and image, potentially revealing underlying issues in the image configuration, functionality, or adherence to specified project guidelines.", has 0 stars, and 16 downloads. This suggests a student project using Docker, possibly related to a Large Language Model (LLM). This image is likely part of a discussion where a student is seeking help about their project being marked as failed despite having a Dockerfile and image. The student probably expects their submission to be assessed based on the Docker image." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="tRxjXpqC5mBAEB7FLLzaX0j5ccg" width="690" height="230" data-dominant-color="1D242C">image713×238 11 KB
