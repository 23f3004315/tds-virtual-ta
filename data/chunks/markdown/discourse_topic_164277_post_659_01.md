**[Discussion Image by HARISH.S]** This image depicts a student's command-line interface (MINGW64 on Windows) during the TDS Project 1. The student navigates to the "hello_world" directory using `cd hello_world`, and then attempts to list the Dockerfile with `ls -l Dockerfile`. However, there's an initial error: "bash: $'\E[200~ls': command not found" which suggests a problem with the command input, likely due to special characters being inserted accidentally during the `ls` command entry. The student then retries the `ls -l Dockerfile` command successfully, displaying the Dockerfile's file permissions, owner, size, and modification date, before issuing control-C (`^C`) to stop execution. This sequence illustrates a common troubleshooting scenario where students might make typing errors and need to correct their command entry to achieve the intended outcome._world' directory using the `cd hello_world` command. They then encounter an error "bash: $'\E[200~ls': command not found" when trying to list the Dockerfile, indicating a malformed or incorrectly pasted command. Following this, the student enters the correct command `ls -l Dockerfile`, which successfully displays the file's details including permissions, owner, size, and last modification time. Finally, the student appears to terminate the session using the `^C` command, which commonly represents a Ctrl+C interrupt." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="8eyfQqJ8vzcH4OKnZONZa6tydHd" width="690" height="269" data-dominant-color="070906">image885Ã—346 15.3 KB
