**[Discussion Image by swatikap]** This image depicts a student's attempt to answer a question about creating a JSON weather forecast description for Los Angeles within the TDS January 2025 GA4 course. The student's input, a JSON-like structure containing dates and weather descriptions, is highlighted in a text area. An error message, "Error: At root: Property name mismatch," is displayed beneath the text area, indicating that the submitted JSON structure does not match the expected format, possibly due to incorrect property names based on the format guide showing dates like `2025-01-01`. This is a clear example of a student encountering a technical error while attempting to follow the formatting guidelines presented in the course material. The "Check" button suggests that the student is attempting to validate their answer against an automated system.xample of the expected output format. This scenario represents a common debugging experience in a coding course." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="pYBbhnDdKs5MmaQkg6nHOi09vC6" width="690" height="271" srcset="**[Discussion Image by swatikap]** This image shows a student attempting a JSON data sourcing exercise, specifically providing a weather forecast for Los Angeles. The example output format above shows date strings mapping to weather descriptions. The student has entered data, but receives an error: "Error: At root: Property name mismatch". The student's JSON structure uses dates as keys with corresponding "Sunny and light winds" descriptions, but their initial date "25-02-16" is causing the error by either being malformed, or outside of the expected input range. The "Check" button at the bottom of the submission area suggests this is a graded exercise., **[Discussion Image by swatikap]** This image shows a student attempting to answer a question about the JSON weather forecast for Los Angeles within the TDS Jan 2025 GA4 discussion thread. The student's input, enclosed in a text box, defines a JSON object with date strings as keys and weather descriptions as values (e.g., "25-02-16": "Sunny and light winds"). However, the "Check" button returns an error message: "Error: At root: Property name mismatch", indicating that the date format or overall structure of the submitted JSON does not match the expected format provided in the example output, which is "YYYY-MM-DD". The example shown includes entries like "2025-01-01": "Sunny with scattered clouds", suggesting the student's error stems from the incorrect date format used as the JSON key. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by swatikap]** This image shows a student's attempt to provide a JSON weather forecast description for Los Angeles, likely in response to a prompt or question within a TDS course discussion. The desired output format example, displayed at the top, uses date strings as keys with associated weather descriptions as values, as in `"2025-01-01": "Sunny with scattered clouds"`. The student's attempt, located below the prompt, includes similar data for multiple dates, such as `"25-02-16": "Sunny and light winds"`, but triggers a "Property name mismatch" error. This suggests the student's solution does not conform to required data types or formatting constraints. The "Check" button implies this is an interactive exercise and the error message is immediately displayed, indicating a likely validation check within the assignment. 2x" data-dominant-color="B4B5B7">image1631Ã—641 34.2 KB
