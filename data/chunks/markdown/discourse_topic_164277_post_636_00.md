@carlton @Jivraj Is there something like peer-review in the project, I found this in the grading document.

**[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image conveys an instructor's clarification regarding the grading structure for Project 1 (P1) and Project 2 (P2) in the TDS Jan 2025 course. It specifies that each project will comprise two graded components: submissions and peer reviews. Further, the image specifies the submissions and peer reviews components will be weighted at 80% and 20% respectively. The instructor intends to remove any ambiguity regarding how student work will be assessed. This should avoid student questions about assessment weightings within the course.rojects will be evaluated based on two parts: submissions and peer reviews. Submissions have a weightage of 80%, while peer reviews contribute to 20% of the overall grade. This post provides information about the course's assessment structure." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 12.58.15 PM" data-base62-sha1="bPnxSnsOAejM5OjTiWG7d4VAveM" width="677" height="28">
