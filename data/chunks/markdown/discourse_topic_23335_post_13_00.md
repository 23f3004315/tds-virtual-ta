well, my choice of dropping might be wrong…but, guided by the following factors.

The recording was perhaps done much earlier as @CKPIITM pointed out in his reply, and so chances are most of it would’ve been already recorded. So, lesser chances to re-record them.

There are no live sessions planned yet for this course… the absence of enough sessions (especially given that it’s a 2-credit course) will worsen the situation.

Finally, I feel I might be able to better appreciate the technicalities and jargon if I finish all other ML courses before taking this up.
