**[Discussion Image by Sudhishnarayan]** This image captures a student's troubleshooting step in the "GA3 - Large Language Models - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]". The instructor advises enabling CORS for OPTIONS and POST methods, allowing all origins and headers. The student has input the API URL endpoint as `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity` in a text field; however, an error message "Error: Expected 3 matches" appears below the field, indicating that the input does not meet the validation criteria, likely requiring 3 exact matching instances as per the assignment requirements. The UI elements shown include a text input field with a red border indicating an error, an error icon to its right, and the specific error message displayed beneath the input field. The student is facing confusion about the expected input format.up headers correctly, indicating a possible problem with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration impacting API communication. This snippet illustrates a student encountering initial setup problems with API connections and needing to troubleshoot both endpoint definition and CORS settings." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-04 214319" data-base62-sha1="jaJMjNVOaI8jM58pkNfNNkjlmEf" width="690" height="82" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Sudhishnarayan]** This image captures a student's interaction with an online assignment or exercise within the TDS "GA3 - Large Language Models" discussion forum. It appears to be a question where the student is providing the API URL endpoint for their implementation, which is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`. The platform highlights the input box in red with an "Error: Expected 3 matches" message, suggesting the student's submission is not what the system expects; the question prompt references enabling CORS to allow OPTIONS and POST methods for the API. This indicates the student may need to adjust their API configuration or submission to meet specific criteria related to CORS or the number of expected matches., **[Discussion Image by Sudhishnarayan]** This image shows a discussion post where a student is likely sharing their API endpoint implementation, `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`. The instructor (or peer) prompts the student to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for `OPTIONS` and `POST` methods and asks for the API URL. An error message is shown, "Error: Expected 3 matches", suggesting a validation failure or problem with input field. The endpoint that student provided `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity` is highlighted, implying it's the source of the validation error, so the instructor (or peer) is asking the student to check the endpoint to fix this issue. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Sudhishnarayan]** This image captures an interaction within a technical discussion forum, specifically related to Large Language Models, where a student is encountering issues with their API endpoint. An instructor or mentor is advising the student to ensure that CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is enabled to allow OPTIONS and POST methods, suggesting that all origins and headers might need to be permitted. The student has provided their API URL, "http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity", but the system reports an error stating "Error: Expected 3 matches", indicating a validation or expected input format issue with the provided URL. The discussion focuses on troubleshooting API connectivity and validation failures, emphasizing the importance of CORS configuration and potentially incorrect API input format. 2x" data-dominant-color="292B2F">Screenshot 2025-02-04 2143191694Ã—202 16.4 KB
