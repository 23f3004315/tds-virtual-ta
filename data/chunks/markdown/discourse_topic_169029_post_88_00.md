For GA-1 question 10,

we need to get the hash of the json, from the site JSON Hash,

I found that underneath it using sha-256 in a function inside the encrypt.js file but still when I implemented the same in python, it is giving a different hash. Can we get the hashing code in python?

Update:

I was successful in getting the hash in js.
