**[Discussion Image by 22f3000585]** This image shows a snippet of output from the Project 1 prerequisite evaluations, indicating a student's submission status. The system checks for several conditions: Docker image presence and public visibility on Docker Hub (PASS), GitHub repository presence and public visibility (PASS), Dockerfile in the root of the GitHub repository (PASS), and an MIT license in the root of the GitHub repository (FAIL). Because the MIT license check failed, the overall prerequisites evaluation failed, resulting in a Project 1 score of 0. The snippet also includes a warning stating that if the minimum requirements are not met, the submission will not be evaluated, signaling the importance of resolving the MIT license issue. The student needs to add an MIT license file to the root directory of their GitHub repository to resolve this issue.se minimum requirements are not met. The evaluations check for the presence and public accessibility of a Docker image in Docker Hub, the GitHub repository, and the Dockerfile in the root directory of the GitHub repository; all of these tests passed. However, the check for the MIT license in the root directory of the GitHub repository failed, causing the overall "Prerequisites" to fail and the "Project 1 Score" to be 0. This likely represents a common issue where students forget to include the required license file in their repository's root directory, causing them to fail the automated checks." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="7q3y5vSuNCEbRkULMI3gUy7P9vF" width="633" height="336">image633×336 7.1 KB
