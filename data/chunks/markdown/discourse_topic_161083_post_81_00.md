@Rohitkumar7463 The hash code is exactly what you see under the column Hash,

7Eâ€¦E5

Thats the Hash code for the file output.txt

A Hash is a *nearly* unique representation of some data within some range dependent on the type of hashing algorithm and the amount of unique pieces of data that need to be encoded. (just my colloquial definition of it, i am sure you are able to ask GPT to give you a much better explanation)

Kind regards
