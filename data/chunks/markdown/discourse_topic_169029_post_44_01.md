To be eligible for the final exam, a student needs an average of >=40/100 from the best two out of the first five weekly assessment scores. The course grade is determined by attendance in the end-term exam and calculated based on weighted components like GAA (best 4 of 7 weekly assignments), ROE1 (Remote Online Exam 1), P1 (take home project 1), P2 (take home project 2), and F (Final end term exam).

The email states that students must achieve an average of 40/100 or greater on their best two out of the first five weekly assessments to be eligible for the final exam, and attending the final exam is mandatory to receive the course grade. The email contains a table outlining the assessment components (ROE1, P1, and P2) with their open, submission, and peer review dates. It also defines the acronym GAA (score in best 4 of 7 weekly assignments) and outlines the formula for calculating the final course score (T) using two different weightages for GAA and the final exam (F). 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1001231]** This email announcement from the IITM BS Team provides students with important information about the eligibility criteria for the end-term exam and the calculation of the final course score in the "Tools in Data Science" course. Students must achieve an average score of at least 40/100 on the best two out of the first five weekly assessments to be eligible for the end-term exam. The email breaks down the grading components, including GAA (best 4 of 7 weekly assignments), ROE1, P1, P2 (take-home projects with submissions and peer reviews), and the final exam (F), detailing their respective weights in two alternative final course score (T) formulas. Specifically, the two weighted formulas are T = 0.1GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2P2 +0.3F and T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2P2 +0.25F, likely used under different circumstances. The email also includes the open, submission, and peer review dates for ROE1, P1, and P2 assessments. 2x" data-dominant-color="D4D4DA">image788Ã—973 265 KB
