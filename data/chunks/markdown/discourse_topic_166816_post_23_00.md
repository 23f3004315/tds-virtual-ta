This is summary from start to finish + doubt clearing

**[Discussion Image by carlton]** The image shows a red play button icon, indicating that the response likely contains a link to a video tutorial or explanation related to the discussion on graded assignments. Since the context is about incorrect or missing scores, the video probably provides guidance on how to navigate the grading dashboard, troubleshoot common issues with grade display, or understand the grading process within the TDS platform. It could also demonstrate how students can check their submissions or report discrepancies in their grades to the instructors, serving as a visual aid to complement the text-based discussion. The video's content should act as a learning resource.der image or icon, and given the context of a discussion about missing grades, this icon likely serves as a generic indicator for a resource related to the course or assignment, potentially a video explanation or tutorial. It is unlikely a direct element causing the "Graded Assignments Dashboard Scores Incorrect/Missing" issue, and might only represent supplemental material relevant to understanding assignments in the course. The icon provides no information about specific errors, code, or navigation steps related to the grading dashboard problem being discussed." class="site-icon" data-dominant-color="FF103A" width="16" height="16">
