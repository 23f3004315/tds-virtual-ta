**[Discussion Image by Jayeshbansal]** This image captures a student's view of their Docker repository on a platform like Docker Hub, as part of a peer discussion in "Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies". The student, named Jayeshbansal, has a repository named "tds_project1" with a size of 77 MB, which can be seen at the top left corner of the image. The "Tags" tab is selected, showing the "latest" tag. It shows instructions to push a new tag using the command `docker push jayeshbansal/tds_project1:tagname` and the `docker pull jayeshbansal/tds_project1:latest` command, which can be copied directly from the interface with a "Copy" button.

The repository size is 77 MB, and it contains a "latest" tag, pushed about one month ago, with the digest '2bdbd090a678' for the linux/amd64 architecture. The right panel displays Docker commands for pushing a new tag, "docker push jayeshbansal/tds_project1:tagname" and pulling the latest tag, "docker pull jayeshbansal/tds_project1:latest," with a "Copy" button next to it. This suggests a discussion around pushing and pulling Docker images within the project, possibly regarding tagging and versioning. The student might be seeking clarification on how to properly use these Docker commands., **[Discussion Image by Jayeshbansal]** This image shows the "Tags" section of the Docker Hub repository for the user "jayeshbansal" and the project "tds_project1," suggesting a student question regarding this interface.
