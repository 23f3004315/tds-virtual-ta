**[Discussion Image by 24f1002359]** This image shows a student's browser displaying the JSON output from a local API endpoint, `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=1A`, accessed during a TDS "Deployment Tools" discussion. The JSON represents an array of "students", where each student object contains "studentId" and "class" keys. All the students shown have the "class" value set to "1A". The browser's "Pretty-print" feature is enabled, which formats the JSON for readability. This likely represents a student verifying their API endpoint is correctly returning data based on a query parameter. alt="Screenshot 2025-02-02 194815" data-base62-sha1="qts04vtP9Z2d5Sh9lc2b0w5GhUY" width="584" height="499" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 24f1002359]** This image depicts a student sharing the output of an API endpoint as part of a discussion on deployment tools within the TDS Jan 2025 cohort. The browser shows the URL `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=1A`, and the displayed JSON output represents a list of "students," each with a "studentId" and a "class" attribute set to "1A". The output suggests the student is testing an API call that filters students by class. There are 6 students with ids: 224, 226, 750, 1241, 1408, and 1704 that are being returned. This image shows a student demonstrating that the endpoint they built and deployed to `127.0.0.1:8000` is functioning properly and returns students in class 1A when queried with the appropriate parameters., **[Discussion Image by 24f1002359]** This image depicts a student's view of a JSON response from a web API, accessed via the URL `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=1A` in a web browser, as part of a discussion about deployment tools. The JSON data represents a list of students, each with a `studentId` and `class` attribute, where the `class` is consistently "1A". The "Pretty-print" option is enabled in the browser, which formats the JSON for better readability. This could represent the expected data output, and the student posting it may be demonstrating a successful deployment or seeking validation of the API endpoint functionality. The student is likely sharing this in response to a prompt related to verifying API endpoint data retrieval within the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion thread. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 24f1002359]** This image depicts a student sharing their API response in the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion thread. The student is accessing the API endpoint `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=1A` via their browser, and the browser's pretty-print function is enabled, which formats the JSON response for readability. The API response is a JSON object containing a "students" array, where each element in the array represents a student object with "studentId" and "class" attributes; all students displayed are in "1A" class, as requested in the query parameters. This output helps confirm that the student's API is functioning correctly by retrieving the requested student data. The purpose of this post is for the student to showcase the successful API call and its response within the ongoing class discussion. 2x" data-dominant-color="161616">Screenshot 2025-02-02 1948151140×975 20 KB
