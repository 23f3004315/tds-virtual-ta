**[Discussion Image by 22f3000585]** This image is from a TDS student discussion thread, acting as feedback related to a Dockerfile submission. The displayed message indicates a checklist failure, likely from an automated grading system. The submission requirements include no unknown repositories, the inclusion of "MIT" in the LICENSE file, and the presence of a Dockerfile. Because of these issues, the submission won't be considered for scoring until these problems are rectified. The text guides the student to review and correct these three specific points in their submission.t be missing or inaccessible; "No 'MIT' in LICENSE," suggesting the required LICENSE file doesn't include the MIT license text; and "No Dockerfile," indicating the absence of a Dockerfile in the submitted materials. The message emphasizes that the submission must pass this checklist to be eligible for scoring. This feedback highlights common submission requirements, likely from an assignment or project within a Docker-focused course. The student needs to address these missing or incorrectly configured elements to proceed." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="rjjwOiznkgyO8ZN691da8R4YY9Q" width="690" height="83" data-dominant-color="F5F5F5">
