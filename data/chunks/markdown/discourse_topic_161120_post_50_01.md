**[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** This image captures a student's successful deployment of a FastAPI application to Vercel, as evidenced by the URL `https://vercel-fastapi-aa0kdktjz-mishkat02s-projects.vercel.app/api?name=IE&name=G6k`. The browser displays JSON output: `{"marks": [58,53]}`, indicating the API endpoint is functioning and returning data. The student has seemingly passed parameters `name=IE` and `name=G6k` in the URL, which the API then processes to return corresponding "marks". This confirms the API's functionality after deployment and addresses any initial concerns about deployment tools. It is an example of a student's working Vercel deployment.data-base62-sha1="lim43PiXEjdjlXTI4ijfw7jeqDQ" width="690" height="431" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** This image shows a student's deployment output in a web browser, indicating they're likely debugging a deployment issue during the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" assignment. The URL `https://vercel-fastapi-aa0kdktjz-mishkat02s-projects.vercel.app/api?name=IE&name=G6k` points to a Vercel deployment, suggesting the student is using Vercel as their deployment tool. The browser displays a JSON response `{"marks": [58,53]}`, which is the output of an API endpoint they've deployed, suggesting that the core deployment itself was successful. This implies that the student may be troubleshooting the API's data output rather than a deployment failure., **[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** This image depicts a web browser window showing the JSON output from a deployed FastAPI application on Vercel. The student is accessing the endpoint `https://vercel-fastapi-aa0kdktjz-mishkat02s-projects.vercel.app/api?name=IE&name=G6k`. The JSON response returned by the API is `{"marks": [50,53]}`, indicating that the API is functioning and returning the expected data for the given input names "IE" and "G6k". This represents a successful deployment and execution of the FastAPI application on the Vercel platform, showcasing the output of the API endpoint. This suggests a peer discussion or a response to a student question, confirming the correct deployment of the application. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** This image depicts a student's deployed FastAPI application on Vercel, showcasing a peer discussion related to the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" assignment. The student, identified by the URL `vercel-fastapi-aa0kdktjz-mishkat02s-projects.vercel.app`, is accessing the `/api` endpoint with query parameters `name=IE&name=G6k`. The browser displays a JSON response in a "Pretty print" format, showing the data `{"marks": [50, 53]}`. This suggests the student is troubleshooting data retrieval from the deployed application, likely testing the endpoint's functionality after deployment. The URL and JSON output provide valuable context for understanding the student's progress and potential challenges in the deployment process. 2x" data-dominant-color="0D0B0B">Screenshot 2025-01-21 at 1.37.06 PM1440Ã—900 28.1 KB
