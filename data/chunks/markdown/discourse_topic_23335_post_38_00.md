Suggestion : **MLP** should be made a corequisite for this course.

Why do I say this?

I took “Tools in Data Science” course last term. And I found it very hard to follow a lot of concepts. But now (I’ve taken MLP course for this term), I’m able to appreciate and understand the content better. Because now I have a basic understanding of different Machine Learning Models and I know where to apply what.

For example in TDS course week 5, we were taught about Pycaret, KMeans clustering and image classification. A lot of it went above my head because I didn’t know what RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression or KMeans Classifier was.

I wish I had taken TDS after completing all ML courses. It would have helped me to understand a lot of DS tools better.
