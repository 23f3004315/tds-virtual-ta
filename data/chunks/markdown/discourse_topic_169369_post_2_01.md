It shows assignment scores for Weeks 1 through 5, with values ranging from 20.00 to 90.00. The main issue raised in the discussion thread is related to "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1," which is labeled as "Absent," indicating the student either did not submit the quiz or the submission was not properly recorded in the system. The context suggests the student is seeking clarification on why the quiz is marked as absent, and whether it reflects a submission error or if they simply missed the deadline. This could lead to troubleshooting steps involving checking submission records or contacting the instructor for clarification and resolution.udent is concerned because "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1" is labeled as "Absent." The dashboard UI indicates that the student has received numerical scores for the weekly assignments, specifically 80.00 for Week 1, 65.00 for Week 2, 21.10 for Week 3, 20.00 for Week 4, and 90.00 for Week 5. The "Absent" status for the quiz suggests the student either missed the quiz or the submission was not correctly recorded, prompting them to seek clarification in the discussion forum. This is likely a student question regarding the meaning and resolution of the "Absent" status." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="eeWI3n3Av2zdEzHI7BwAF65PcJL" width="382" height="386">image382Ã—386 19 KB
