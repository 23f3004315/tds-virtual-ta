**[Discussion Image by 22f3000585]** This image shows the output of a pre-requisites check script, likely related to a student project in the TDS program, with "1" indicating pass and "0" indicating fail. The script verifies the existence and public accessibility of both Docker and GitHub repositories, ensuring their timestamps are before February 18th, which both pass. However, the check for the existence of a LICENSE or LICENSE.md file with an MIT License in the GitHub repository fails, indicated by the "0". The check confirms the presence of a Dockerfile in the GitHub repository, which passes. This suggests the student is missing an MIT license file in their GitHub repository and needs to add it to pass the pre-requisite check.ith '1' indicating pass and '0' indicating fail. Specifically, the Docker and GitHub repositories are correctly identified as existing and public, and the Dockerfile is confirmed. However, the check for the MIT License fails; the system can't find a LICENSE or LICENSE.md file in the GitHub repository, which is a required condition. The student is confused because the check incorrectly assesses the existence of the license file." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="oH2keFnLQUY6KRyC4FD0UCVIGfi" width="652" height="156">image652Ã—156 5.43 KB
