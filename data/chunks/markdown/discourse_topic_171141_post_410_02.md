I think the mistake would have been because in my repo the file name is “dockerfile” and you have mentioned it as “Dockerfile” . So is it a mistake to put “D” in lowercase.

Kindly look into this sir because of this I got 0 in project 1 even though many of the tasks of my projects passed the evaluation test.
