Hello, I think the format of the response body should be like: { “matches” : [ “ABC”, “ABC”, “ABC”]}. I think it is because of your formatting issue.

**[Discussion Image by sha_512_av]** This image shows a response received in Postman after sending a POST request to the `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity` endpoint, which is likely part of an LLM application. The request uses "No Auth" for authorization. The response body is in JSON format and contains a key called "matches", which is an array of three strings or text snippets: "FastAPI is great for APIs.", "Embedding models improve NLP.", and "Machine learning is evolving.". The status code of the response is "200 OK", indicating that the request was successful and the server returned the expected data. The response time was 17.26 seconds and the size of the response body was 232 bytes. This indicates a successful interaction with a local API endpoint designed to return similar or matched text snippets.validation during the discussion." alt="Screenshot_20250204_032923" data-base62-sha1="2XkfF0of6iQ2mlpOHK7MV8ecXy9" width="690" height="428" srcset="**[Discussion Image by sha_512_av]** This image depicts a successful API call using Postman, suggesting a student is working on a coding assignment related to LLMs. The student has set up a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity` and selected "No Auth" under the Authorization tab. The response body, formatted as JSON, shows a "matches" array containing three strings: "FastAPI is great for APIs.", "Embedding models improve NLP.", and "Machine learning is evolving.". The bottom of the window indicates a 200 OK status, with a response time of 17.26 seconds and a size of 232B, meaning the API endpoint returned data successfully without errors. This indicates the student has properly configured the API endpoint and is receiving a valid response from a server-side application, likely part of an LLM task in the course., **[Discussion Image by sha_512_av]** This image captures a student's interaction with the Postman API client, showing a successful POST request to the `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity` endpoint. The authorization type is set to "No Auth," and the request body contains a JSON response with a "matches" array, listing three strings: "FastAPI is great for APIs.", "Embedding models improve NLP.", and "Machine learning is evolving." The response status is "200 OK," indicating that the request was successful, with a response time of 17.26 seconds and a size of 232 bytes. The student appears to be verifying the output of a similarity endpoint in their LLM application and the screenshot validates the expected output. The display is a typical representation of successful API testing, showing configuration and results. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by sha_512_av]** This image depicts a student's interaction with a FastAPI application using Postman, showing a successful API call for similarity matching. The student sent a POST request to the `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity` endpoint without authorization and included a request body (though the body content is not visible). The server responded with a 200 OK status, and the response body, formatted as JSON, contains a "matches" array, which includes strings like "FastAPI is great for APIs.", "Embedding models improve NLP.", and "Machine learning is evolving.", suggesting the application successfully performed some kind of similarity matching task and returned related texts. This Postman interface shows the student exploring the API endpoint and confirming its basic functionality. The student has configured the Auth Type to "No Auth" and is viewing the response body in JSON format. 2x" data-dominant-color="242425">Screenshot_20250204_032923991×615 43.7 KB
