**[Discussion Image by thinkmachine]** This image depicts a student's project submission results, showing the automated checks for Project 1. The first check, "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public," failed, which is highlighted in red, causing the overall "Prerequisites" to fail and the project score to be 0. Despite the Docker image failure, the subsequent checks for the GitHub repository, Dockerfile in the root, and MIT license all passed, indicated by the "PASS" status. This suggests the student may need to investigate why their Docker image is not publicly available on Docker Hub, even though the other project components are correctly set up, and the student is potentially confused by the later successes despite the first test failing. The student likely needs to make their Docker image public or ensure it's correctly linked to their Docker Hub account.lic" check has failed, which is highlighted and causing a "Prerequisites: FAIL" status and a score of 0. Despite the Docker image failing, the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license all pass the checks, shown with "PASS" next to each item. The student is confused about why the project failed since the Dockerfile is present, indicated by "???" written next to the Dockerfile "PASS" status. The context suggests the core issue revolves around publishing the Docker image correctly on Docker Hub with public visibility." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="3HoFXyYqbYD2IGHEd2R2HnPbOkR" width="412" height="167">image412Ã—167 4.49 KB
