**[Discussion Image by 23f2004313]** This image shows a snippet of a spreadsheet, likely used in a data visualization assignment within the TDS Jan 2025 cohort's GA7 module. It displays tabular data with columns labeled "Series ID," "Year," "Period," "Label," and "Value." The "Period" column contains month codes (e.g., "M01"), and the "Label" column contains corresponding month names (e.g., "2023 Jan"). The "Value" column shows numerical data (e.g., "562.445"). This data would be used to construct data visualizations for trends over time in this context.d "Value." The "Period" column contains values such as "M01" and "M02", while the "Label" column contains corresponding values like "2023 Jan" and "2023 Feb," indicating a transformation of the period data. The "Value" column shows numerical data, such as 562.445, which is presumably the data being visualized. This suggests a student or instructor is illustrating the structure of the dataset or demonstrating data cleaning and formatting necessary before visualization." alt="{F9711583-E074-489A-AC90-154B9309F786}" data-base62-sha1="mZr2YMiCdgUHIMaAs4UsgSQhqxz" width="653" height="81">
