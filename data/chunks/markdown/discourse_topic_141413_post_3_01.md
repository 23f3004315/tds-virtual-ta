.11% if you score 100% in it. The TRUE effect **is lower** if you take into consideration you can offset at least 25% of that loss with bonus questions (worth 5% of the TDS grade)!

A little over dramatic a statement considering the data we now have considered above. The reality is the ROE is worth 0.83% of your overall diploma CGPA (and that too this is the worst case, i.e. for direct diploma students! For those that started from foundation its impact **is even smaller! 0.52%)**

What is my opinion on ROE? It made me a better student. I was truly humbled by the experience. It gave me a realistic view of my abilities and the level I need to attain so that I can be confident in the value I am adding to the client. Who is the client? The businesses I might deal with, the companies I contract for.

If there was no value attached to the ROE (i.e. you have no stake in it) then all the evidence points to one very simple truth. Nearly no one taking it seriously.

many of us are struggling to maintain good CGPAs to progress to the degree level.

My mother has always said one thing to me. Its only an undergraduate degree. If you are struggling in year 2, then stop wasting your time, its not meant for you.
