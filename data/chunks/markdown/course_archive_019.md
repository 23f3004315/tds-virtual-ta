## Image classification with Python (Keras)

[**[Course Image: Image classification with Python]** This image shows a Kaggle notebook used for classifying chess piece images, emphasizing the use of archived datasets for machine learning projects. It demonstrates how to access and organize image datasets within a Google Colab environment, with a specific focus on a "Chessman-image-dataset" containing images of different chess pieces like bishops, kings, knights, pawns, queens, and rooks. A critical step involves preparing the dataset by extracting class names and creating labels using NumPy functions, effectively archiving the label data for training. This notebook utilizes Python and libraries like NumPy to process the archived image data, enabling image classification through machine learning. This demonstrates how archived data can be utilized for machine learning projects.et is organized and prepared within a Kaggle notebook environment, demonstrating a key step in archiving data for machine learning projects. Specifically, it highlights a folder structure labeled "Chessman-image-dataset," containing subfolders for each chess piece (Bishop, King, Knight, Pawn, Queen, Rook) used for image classification. Further, the image shows code used to preprocess labels from the image data, converting string labels of the chess pieces into numerical labels that the model can use. In the demonstrated code, the class names are extracted from the "train.class_names," then the label for each training image is identified using `np.argmax`. By reviewing this structure, students can understand how to organize and prepare image datasets for similar classification tasks.)](https://youtu.be/59u3XMiSyro)
