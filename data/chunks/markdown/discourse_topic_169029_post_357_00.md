Also a better evaluation strat would be to submit the GitHub repo in the form(Else they can make changes to the repo, who checks the commit history?) and maybe conduct a 2 min demo where the student clones the repo and then you run the script?

I know many students are there but other subjects do it for project courses?

Maybe a helpful tip for next time

If i do fail and repeat this course. Hopefully not XD
