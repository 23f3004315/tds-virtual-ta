Hi Guddu ,

I didnâ€™t make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ?

command that I used :

`uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data`

here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system.

Kind regards

Jivraj
