**[Discussion Image by 23f2003413]** This image depicts a student's troubleshooting process during the TDS Project 1, focused on LLM-based Automation Agents. The screenshot shows the response from an API call, indicating a "500 Internal Server Error" with a detailed message revealing an authentication problem: "Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}". This error suggests that the authentication token being used by the student's agent is not recognized or trusted by the server providing the API, potentially due to incorrect configuration of API keys or authentication settings. The student likely posted this to the discussion thread to seek guidance on resolving the "invalid_issuer" authentication error, implying a need for help with properly configuring the authentication credentials for the project's API integration. The image highlights a common issue when working with APIs and authentication in LLM agent development, providing a concrete example of the troubleshooting challenges faced by students.shot shows the "Response" tab of a developer tool (likely in a browser), indicating a "500 Internal Server Error" with a size of 184 bytes and a response time of 792ms. The JSON response body reveals the detail: "Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}". This indicates that the authentication token being used by the student's agent is not recognized or trusted by the server, which is a common issue during API integration. The student likely needs to verify the correctness of their API keys/tokens and ensure they are using the right issuer or authorization method." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="q01Z1oXJ91KyKi8L0O0z9n1dYAQ" width="684" height="316">image684Ã—316 12.7 KB
