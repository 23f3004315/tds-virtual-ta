**[Discussion Image by 23f2003413]** This image depicts an error response received by a student, likely from an API call within the TDS Project 1 LLM-based Automation Agent project. The error message, specifically the "detail" field, indicates "Error code: 401" and states that "Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer." The error's type is identified as "invalid_request_error" and the code is "invalid_issuer," suggesting an issue with how the authentication token was generated or configured during the API request. This is likely a student question regarding authentication and authorization within the context of using an LLM to interact with an external service. The displayed UI elements include tabs for "Response," "Headers," "Cookies," "Results," and "Docs," and a "Copy" button, which implies this is a display of the response in a tool like Postman or an integrated development environment with API testing capabilities.he response, formatted as a JSON object, indicates a 401 error with the detail "Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer." Further details within the error object include the 'type' as 'invalid_request_error', 'param' as None, and 'code' as 'invalid_issuer'. This suggests a problem with the student's authentication setup, where the token being used is not recognized or trusted by the API's issuer. The display is within a UI that features tabs for "Response", "Headers", "Cookies", "Results", and "Docs", also includes a "Copy" button for easy copying of the response." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="qugZ0sw5CBFFOJtKl2Mvz5NUDkE" width="690" height="188" data-dominant-color="282524">image706Ã—193 6.15 KB
