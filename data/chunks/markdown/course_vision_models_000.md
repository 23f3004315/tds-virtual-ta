## Vision Models

[**[Course Image: LLM Vision Models]** The image shows a file explorer window containing various image files, including "cricket.jpg," within the context of learning about vision models. The central focus is on the displayed image of a cricket player, highlighting how LLMs can be used to interpret images, extract features, and understand the context within them. This demonstrates a practical application of vision models in analyzing visual data, such as identifying objects (a cricket player) and understanding scenes (a cricket match). This fits into the "vision-models" curriculum by illustrating how images serve as input for these models. Using vision models we can perform tasks such as understanding of sport, teams, and players based solely on images.s are used in Vision Models: The image displayed in the explorer shows a cricket player in action, named Suryakumar Yadav, likely used as an example for vision model processing. In the context of vision models, this image can be fed into a model to identify objects (like the player, bat, helmet, and jersey), analyze the scene, or classify the image based on its content. Vision models leverage techniques like object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation to understand and interpret images. This example could demonstrate how a model can recognize athletes or analyze sports scenes. The image file is named "cricket.jpg," indicating that it will likely be processed by a vision model to identify and analyze objects within the image.)](https://youtu.be/FgT_Mk_bakQ)

You'll learn how to use LLMs to interpret images and extract useful information, covering:

- **Setting Up Vision Models**: Integrate vision capabilities with LLMs using APIs like OpenAI's Chat Completion.
- **Sending Image URLs for Analysis**: Pass URLs or base64-encoded images to LLMs for processing.
- **Reading Image Responses**: Get detailed textual descriptions of images, from scenic landscapes to specific objects like cricketers or bank statements.
- **Extracting Data from Images**: Convert extracted image data to various formats like Markdown tables or JSON arrays.
- **Handling Model Hallucinations**: Address inaccuracies in extraction results, understanding how different prompts can affect output quality.
- **Cost Management for Vision Models**: Adjust detail settings (e.g., "detail: low") to balance cost and output precision.
