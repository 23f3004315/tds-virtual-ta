**[Discussion Image by Sunil_mv]** This image depicts a multiple-choice question from a graded assignment within the TDS platform. The question asks the student to identify the key factor influencing motorcycle resale value using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. The student selected an incorrect answer and received a "No, the answer is incorrect" message and a score of 0. The correct answer, as indicated under "Accepted Answers," is "'Mileage: 0.03'". This shows the system's feedback on a student's attempt and reveals the correct solution for this particular question. The student's confusion likely stems from needing to correctly apply the provided context and select the most appropriate correlation coefficient value based on the given factors. This is a closed-ended question with a single correct answer that highlights correlation analysis in a real-world scenario." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="lBf64UZa2qvheoQRCs5jwb7qv4X" width="690" height="329" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Sunil_mv]** This image captures a student attempting a multiple-choice question on an assignment, and receiving immediate feedback.
