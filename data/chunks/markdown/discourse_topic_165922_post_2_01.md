.txt.

• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.

**Specifying Versions in requirements.txt**

• If you **don’t specify a version**, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.

---

• If you **do specify a version (package==1.2.3)**, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.

**Handling Version Conflicts**

• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.

• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:

• Using **greater than/less than constraints**: package&gt;=1.2,&lt;2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).

• Running pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.

**Best Practices Summary**

Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).
Use a **requirements.txt** file for reproducibility.
Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.
Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.

Kind regards
