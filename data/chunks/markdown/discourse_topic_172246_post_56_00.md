Thank you for raising a proper point about the fairness of the issue. The course’s rules seems to be changed on a whim, which is pretty unfair to those of us who completed the first 6 assignments properly. If anything, why not inform the +5 bonus before declaring the GA-7. “Rewarding diligence” is a vague point as completing 6 out of 7 assignments requires a decent commitment to the course. Getting rewarded for completing all 7 assignments is something absolutely commendable, without a doubt but getting a +5 on the basis of simply GA-7 is vague because it doesn’t guarantee the commitment towards the other 6 assignments. A person who has completed 6 assignments, skipping GA 7 is less diligent than someone who completed 4 assignments including GA7 is the summary I am gathering : )

Please correct me if I am wrong
