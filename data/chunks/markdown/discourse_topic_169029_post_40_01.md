**[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** This image shows a student's command-line interaction attempting to use `curl` to send a POST request to a server. The student is sending a multi-part form with a "question" parameter containing a detailed instruction set, including downloading and extracting a zip file, moving files, renaming files based on a digit-shifting scheme, and then executing a `grep | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` pipeline in bash. The request includes a file upload of `qmove.zip`. The server's response is a JSON object with an "answer" field containing a string that appears to be some text followed by a SHA256 hash. This represents a student's attempt to interact with a service, likely as part of a project assignment, and indicates successful communication with the service as evidenced by the returned JSON response.g the task to perform on a downloaded and extracted `qmove.zip` file) and the "file" parameter specifying the `qmove.zip` file itself. The task involves extracting the zip, moving files, renaming files (incrementing digits), and then piping the output of `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum`. The response from the API, shown in JSON format, includes an "answer" field, but the content appears to contain the word "text" followed by a SHA256 hash." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="30ERKum5emkUvWSG8eaz6wAULMK" width="690" height="81" data-dominant-color="343841">image1260Ã—149 8.95 KB
