I encountered an HTTP 500 error with the following detail:

`{
"detail": "'choices'"
}
`
This issue appears across all tasks, even though they were running fine before submission. I suspect there might be a problem with APIPROXY_TOKEN. Could you please look into this?

Additionally, my solution is very similar to the one shared by the System Commands team in their email.
