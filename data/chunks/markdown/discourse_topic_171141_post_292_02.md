**[Discussion Image by Srishty_Snehi]** This image from a student discussion thread shows a screenshot of a GitHub repository named "Project_1_tds" belonging to user "SrishtySnehi." The repository has one contributor and a default icon featuring a red T-shaped symbol within a square. The GitHub interface displays metrics such as zero issues, zero stars, and zero forks for this repository. This suggests a student's initial setup or a newly created repository for a TDS (likely The Data School) project, potentially shared to troubleshoot issues or seek guidance. The context is a student facing discrepancies with an official project and using the repository to showcase the specific issue.shared as part of a peer discussion about discrepancies. The repository has a single contributor (SrishtySnehi), no open issues, stars, or forks, and is represented by a visual logo of a red building-block type structure. The image is being shared within the larger discussion to potentially highlight issues or concerns with the project's initial setup or submission. This likely reflects a student's question about their project setup compared to expected outcomes based on course guidelines." class="thumbnail" data-dominant-color="F4F5F6">
