**[Discussion Image by 24f2006531]** This image captures a section of the project instructions from the TDS Solver project discussion, specifically relating to application deployment. It provides guidance to students, instructing them to "Deploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone" and offering flexibility in choosing a deployment platform, suggesting "Vercel" as one possible option. The context is about providing students with the requirement and possible platforms to deploy their application. This is part of the project requirements that a student might be clarifying. to a public URL accessible by anyone, suggesting they can use platforms like Vercel. This guidance is likely intended to help students complete the deployment aspect of the project successfully, allowing others to test and evaluate their work. The content shown is introductory information for the deployment stage, rather than a specific student question or troubleshooting scenario. The instruction acts as a starting point for students who may be unfamiliar with deploying web applications." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="bWR3IysfcTnDLV6d4UxVfDTqCEW" width="690" height="127" data-dominant-color="2F393F">image935Ã—173 6.54 KB
