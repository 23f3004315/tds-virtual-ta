**[Discussion Image by afsalshah]** This image is a screenshot showing the results of a Project 1 prerequisite check, revealing that the student is failing due to issues with their GitHub repository. Specifically, the GitHub repository itself, the Dockerfile, and the MIT license are not being detected in the root of the GitHub repository, causing the GitHub repo test to fail. Despite the Docker image being successfully found and publicly accessible on Docker Hub, the overall prerequisites check fails and the Project 1 score remains at 0. The initial instruction text outlines the necessary conditions for the project, including GitHub repository existence, a valid MIT license, a valid Dockerfile, Docker image accessibility, and the consistency of the Dockerfile between the image and the repository. If these conditions are not met, the submission will not be evaluated.t's current status shows "Prerequisites: FAIL" and a "Project 1 Score: 0," indicating that these issues must be resolved for their submission to be evaluated. This is likely a student question, seeking help with configuring the github repository properly and fulfilling the project's requirements." alt="1" data-base62-sha1="6mibDRJspDln0P0tPtHV2gZLc4n" width="690" height="294" srcset="**[Discussion Image by afsalshah]** This image shows the initial evaluation feedback for a student's TDS Project 1, highlighting prerequisite checks. It indicates the project requires a public and accessible GitHub repository, a LICENSE file with the MIT license, a valid Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image. The evaluation output shows that while the Docker image is present and public, the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license file are failing the checks, resulting in a failing "Prerequisites" status and a project score of 0. This likely represents a student question regarding why these checks are failing, potentially stemming from confusion around repository setup or file placement within the GitHub repository. The student needs to ensure the Github repo exists, is public, and contains a Dockerfile and an MIT license file in the root directory., **[Discussion Image by afsalshah]** This image shows a student's evaluation results for Project 1 prerequisites. It outlines five requirements for the project, including having a public GitHub repository with an MIT license and a valid Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image. The evaluation indicates that while the Docker image is present and public (PASS), the GitHub repository is failing to be recognized as present and public (FAIL), as is the Dockerfile and MIT license within the repository's root (FAIL). The overall Prerequisites check returns FAIL, resulting in a Project 1 score of 0. This suggests the student needs to address the visibility and file presence issues in their GitHub repository to meet the project requirements. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by afsalshah]** This image depicts an automated feedback message from the TDS project submission system, indicating a student's Project 1 prerequisite evaluations have failed, resulting in a score of 0. The evaluation checklist requires: a public GitHub repository, an MIT license file, a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image, and matching Dockerfiles between the repository and image. While the Docker image is correctly present and public in Docker Hub (PASS), the checks for the GitHub repository being present and public, the Dockerfile's presence in the root of the repository, and the MIT license's presence all result in FAIL. This feedback assists students in troubleshooting repository setup and file placement before final submission. 2x" data-dominant-color="F5F5F5">1885×378 56.1 KB
