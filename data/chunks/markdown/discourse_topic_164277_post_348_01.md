**[Discussion Image by 21f3002277]** This image shows a student's attempt to execute the `datagen.py` script as part of a project, using the `subprocess.run` command within a `lm.py` script in VS Code. The `lm.py` script first prints the absolute path to the `/data` directory, downloads the `datagen.py` script from a specified URL using `curl`, and then attempts to execute the downloaded script using `uv run datagen.py` with an email argument. The terminal output shows the Uvicorn server starting, indicating that the `app.py` script (likely a server application) is running successfully, followed by the completed process of executing `lm.py` and the successful POST request to the `datagen.py` script. The student seems to have successfully implemented the steps for downloading and running the `datagen.py` script within their project environment, as indicated by the 200 OK response in the terminal.ssfully downloaded and executed." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-15 071910" data-base62-sha1="oQJF4dWyOs4fDfQrPxf5Xm8i3q0" width="690" height="367" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 21f3002277]** This image captures a student's attempt to run the `llm.py` script, likely part of Project 1. The script downloads and executes `datagen.py` using `subprocess.run`. The code shows the `script_url` pointing to a GitHub raw content URL and `email_arg` being a student email. The terminal output shows the Uvicorn server running and a successful POST request related to running the `datagen.py` script with the email argument. The terminal also prints details about the data generation process, including a disclaimer that the script might change before the evaluation, suggesting a possible peer discussion or a student attempting to troubleshoot the script's execution., **[Discussion Image by 21f3002277]** This image shows a student's VS Code environment while working on Project 1, likely encountering an issue with running the `datagen.py` script within the LLM-based automation agent. The `llm.py` script attempts to download and execute `datagen.py` using `subprocess.run`. The student's code contains the download of the data generation file by using `curl`, and then attempting to run the downloaded `datagen.py` file with `uv`. The terminal output shows the server starting successfully and the `POST` request for task `/run` returning a 200 OK status, but doesn't show successful execution of `datagen.py` script and its impact on '/data/data' folder. The student appears to be following instructions, and the success status does not indicate any immediate errors. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 21f3002277]** This image shows a student's attempt to run the `app.py` script for an LLM-based automation agent project within a VS Code environment connected to a WSL Ubuntu instance. The `llm.py` file imports `os` and `subprocess`, and includes code to download and execute a `datagen.py` script from a specified URL, passing the student's email as an argument. The terminal output displays messages indicating the server started successfully and that the `datagen.py` script was downloaded and executed, returning a 200 OK status. The output also shows the `uv run app.py` command and its info messages about application startup and completion. It indicates that files were created in the `/data/data/` directory, suggesting the script ran successfully. 2x" data-dominant-color="1F1F1F">Screenshot 2025-02-15 0719101919Ã—1021 71.3 KB
