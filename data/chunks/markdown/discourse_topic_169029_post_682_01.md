**[Discussion Image by Adityism]** This image depicts a student's question in the TDS Solver project discussion, showcasing an error they encountered while using the API. The provided JSON output indicates that several test cases ("GA1_q18", "GA4_q6") failed, with a status of "FAILED". The error message for each case is "HTTP 405: Method Not Allowed," accompanied by an HTML structure indicating the same. This suggests the student might be using the wrong HTTP method (e.g., GET instead of POST) when making the API requests to the specified URL `https://tds-solver-bml0qi7k5-adityas-projects-07f86c8b.vercel.app/`. This problem requires checking the required method in the API documentation or implementation to resolve.rors. To fix this, the student needs to review the API documentation and ensure they are using the correct HTTP method for the "test_code" parameter they are sending." alt="WhatsApp Image 2025-04-17 at 19.08.01" data-base62-sha1="iOA12lpo7I0c3hozKLXagvQge76" width="690" height="166" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Adityism]** This image shows a snippet of JSON data representing the output of a student's TDS solver project. The JSON objects contain information about API calls made to a Vercel app (specifically `tds-solver-bml0qi7k5-adityas-projects-07f86c8b.vercel.app/`) with different test codes ("GA1_q18" and "GA4_q6"). The "status" field indicates that these tests "FAILED", and the "error" field contains an "HTTP 405: Method Not Allowed" error, along with the accompanying HTML structure suggesting the method used is not permitted for the requested URL. This suggests the student may be using the wrong HTTP method (e.g., GET instead of POST) for these particular API endpoints, or the endpoint might not be configured to accept requests for the given test codes. The data displayed is part of a student discussion thread, indicating they are likely troubleshooting why their tests are failing with 405 errors., **[Discussion Image by Adityism]** This image depicts a student's error log from the TDS solver project, indicating a "405 Method Not Allowed" error. The JSON output shows that the API requests for "GA1_q18" and "GA4_q6" test codes both resulted in a "FAILED" status, with the error message containing HTML code stating "The method is not allowed for the requested URL." This suggests the student is encountering an issue with the HTTP method used for the API endpoint, likely using GET instead of POST or vice-versa, when trying to submit or retrieve data for these test cases. The student needs to verify the correct HTTP method required by the API for those specific test codes. The problem may stem from the code's interaction with the TDS solver API, specifically how requests are formulated and sent. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Adityism]** This image shows a student's failed API test results from the "Project 2 - TDS Solver" assignment. The output is in JSON format, displaying results for two test cases, "GA1_q18" and "GA4_q6". Both tests have a "status" of "FAILED" and an "error" message indicating an HTTP 405 "Method Not Allowed" error, with the detailed HTML error output also included in the error field. This suggests a problem with the HTTP method used to access the API endpoint, likely the student is using GET instead of POST or some other required method. The API endpoint URL is "https://tds-solver-bml0qi7k5-adityas-projects-07f86c8b.vercel.app/". 2x" data-dominant-color="F6F6F6">WhatsApp Image 2025-04-17 at 19.08.011600Ã—385 66.9 KB
