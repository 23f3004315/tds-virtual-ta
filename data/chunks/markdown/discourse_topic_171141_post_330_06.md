**[Discussion Image by 23f2003751]** This image shows a "Pre-requisites check" list, likely part of an automated script or assignment evaluation for a TDS project. The checks are: Docker repo exists and is public (timestamp before Feb 18th), Github repo exists and is public (timestamp before Feb 18th), LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License) in Github repo, and a Dockerfile exists in the Github repo. The results indicate that the Docker and Github repos exist and are public with the correct timestamps, and the Github repo contains a LICENSE file. However, the Github repo is missing a Dockerfile, resulting in a "0" for that check, signifying a failure. This suggests the student needs to add a Dockerfile to their Github repository to meet the project requirements.ia include the existence and public accessibility of both a Docker and a GitHub repository created before February 18th, each marked with a "1" indicating a pass. The presence of either a LICENSE or LICENSE.md file (specifically an MIT License) in the GitHub repository also passed, marked with a "1". However, the check for a Dockerfile in the GitHub repository failed, marked with a "0", signifying a missing or improperly configured Dockerfile. Therefore, the student is facing an issue with the Dockerfile setup in their GitHub repository, as it is not detected by the automated check." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="cguFlhUIw1ujkDBstIwdfq9uP3T" width="686" height="141">image686Ã—141 5.46 KB
