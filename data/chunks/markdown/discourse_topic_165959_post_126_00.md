## Post #126 by 23f2004042

**Direct Link**: [Post #126](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/165959/126)

There are only four texts which look like link texts in the pdf.

All four properly coded in link markdown syntax, in the preview, they appear as link texts same as in pdf.

Link text

Even after chaning all the 4 texts which appered in blue color in the pdf to link texts,

below error is still observed.

Error: Missing links

Did anyone else face same issue ?

Also, no text in the pdf looks like a code block.

But, Missing Code error was seen and after changing one of the paragraph by using markdown code syntax that error is gone.

Appreciate any suggestions on the link error.
