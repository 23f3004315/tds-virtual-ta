The score drops because some questions may require you to either keep a server turned on or some dynamic changes may occur for some questions (The dynamic changes are intentional in some questions, in order to get students to learn by doing. So if you solved everything and the score is the maximum… just make that your last submission. The score you see is the score you will get for your last submission).

If you want check a question without submitting. Then just use the check button instead. But your last submission is whats scored.
