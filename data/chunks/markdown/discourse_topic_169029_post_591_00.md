## Post #591 by 24f1002359

**Direct Link**: [Post #591](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/169029/591)

I’m writing to clarify the status of my Project 2, which is currently marked as “Absent”. I would like to respectfully state that I **submitted the form before the deadline** — specifically on 31st March 2025 at 22:11 , and I have the response copy as proof.

I would also like to emphasize that:

No edits were made to the form after submission.

I did not make any changes to the project or submission after the deadline.

My Vercel API is still active and functioning as expected.

Here are the submitted links:

GitHub Repo: GitHub - itskaiffazal/tdsproject2: Tools in data science Project 2 - TDS Solver

API Endpoint: https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/

I kindly request you to review my submission and take the necessary steps to update the status.
