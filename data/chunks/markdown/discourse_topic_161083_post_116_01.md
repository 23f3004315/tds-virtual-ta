**[Discussion Image by 23f2000098]** This image shows an exercise or question posed within a TDS student discussion about development tools, specifically `npx` and `prettier`. The instructor prompts students to download a `README.md` file, navigate to the directory where it was saved, and execute the command `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum`. The exercise asks students to then provide the output of the command, and one possible (correct) output is given: `AC06784D6825497650083DDFD6746A2CDD561B6A1FF45241C6A354035244A75C`. This task is designed to familiarize students with using `npx` to run a specific version of `prettier` on a file and then pipe the output to `sha256sum` to generate a checksum. to download a `README.md` file, navigate to the directory where it was downloaded, and then execute the command `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum`. The post concludes by asking "What is the output of the command?", and provides a SHA256 hash value in a red-bordered text box: `AC06784D6825497650083DDFD6746A2CDD561B6A1FF45241C6A354035244A75C`. This implies students need to verify the integrity of the output after running the command and check if it matches the provided hash, ensuring proper execution." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="oYvBwXVvE1UU3W7roht6YqNDiFe" width="690" height="135" data-dominant-color="FAF8F9">image1199Ã—236 8.5 KB
