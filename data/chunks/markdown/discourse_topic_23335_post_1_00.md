## Post #1 by jkmadathil

**Direct Link**: [Post #1](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/23335/1)

This category is created to address **subject-specific queries** related to *Tools in Data Science*

`- Why should people use this category? What is it for?
`
The larger goal of the Discourse forum is to act as a Knowledge base for the course. You can make this more productive by

Elaborating your question sufficiently and supporting it with steps that you have already tried at your end before posting this question

Sharing additional content or explanations related to the topic being discussed

`- Are there any rules for posting in this category?
`

Before you create a new post, **review the existing threads** to see if there are already highly similar or identical postings. Discourse will suggest similar posts once you start typing titles

**Tag the post appropriately** so that it gets indexed correctly in our Knowledge Base. For instance, if your query is on an Activity Question in Week 1 then use the tags #activity-question, #week-1

**Provide a meaningful title to your post** that contains the topic/details of your query so that it can be searched by others easily. For instance: Do not use the titles like *“AQ1.1 Q3”* which just gives question number alone. Instead use a more meaningful title like - *“Need help in calculating the N^{th} prime number”*
