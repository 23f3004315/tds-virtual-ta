Thanks for the answer sir.

I remember being told on the last session, that the question will be exactly the same we have on the assignment portal for my respective case, and the answer on the portal can be the same here as well.

Actually I am exploring a hardcoded answer route where if i return the answer which I already got after solving the questions on the portal (in certain qns with dynamic functions) , so thought of asking if method is alright.
