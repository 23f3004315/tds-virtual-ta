HELLO SIR , DOCKET IMAGE PRESENT IN DOCKER HUB AND IT IS PUBLIC THEN WHY IT IS FAIL

---

**[Discussion Image by 23f2004644]** This image shows an automated evaluation of Project 1 prerequisites, indicating a student question regarding failing conditions. The evaluation results show that the Github repo, Dockerfile, and MIT license were correctly placed and public, resulting in a PASS status for these checks. However, the "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public" check resulted in a FAIL status, leading to an overall "Prerequisites: FAIL" and a Project 1 score of 0. The student likely needs help understanding why their Docker image is not being recognized or is not public in Docker Hub.e system checks for the presence and public accessibility of the Docker image on Docker Hub, the GitHub repository, the Dockerfile, and the MIT license within the GitHub repository root. The student's evaluation indicates that while the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license are correctly set up, the Docker image is either not present on Docker Hub or not publicly accessible, causing the "Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public" check to fail and resulting in an overall "Prerequisites: FAIL" and a Project 1 score of 0. The student must address the Docker image issue by either pushing the image to Docker Hub or making it publicly accessible to meet the project requirements. This automated evaluation is acting as a critical learning tool, highlighting the need for meticulous attention to detail in following deployment and configuration instructions." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="gDCCqNTeh9GKxT8mQBZUoKyScfs" width="619" height="241">image619Ã—241 5.07 KB
