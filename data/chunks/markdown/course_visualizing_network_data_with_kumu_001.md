[**[Course Image: Network analysis – filtering by year]** This image demonstrates data preparation steps using a Colab notebook, specifically for visualizing network data with Kumu. The notebook focuses on cleaning and structuring data before importing it into Kumu. It shows an example dataset with columns such as 'titleType', 'primaryTitle', and 'startYear', indicating movie or episode information. In the shown step, the 'title' and 'startYear' column are being filtered with the condition 'title'[’startYear’] > ‘2010’. This pre-processing is crucial for creating effective network visualizations by ensuring data consistency and relevance.n within a Jupyter Notebook environment, likely utilizing a library like Pandas, for subsequent network visualization with Kumu. The screenshot shows a tabular data structure with columns such as "titleType", "primaryTitle", and "startYear", suggesting a dataset of movies or TV shows. Code snippets display commands related to accessing data, examining data types with object outputs, and filtering data based on specific values in the "startYear" column. This step is crucial for cleaning and structuring data before it can be effectively visualized as a network in Kumu. The goal is to enable users to filter the dataset by year to see the relational links within the network change over time.)](https://youtu.be/oi4fDzqsCes)
