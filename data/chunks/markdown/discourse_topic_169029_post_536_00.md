Hi @carlton

@Saransh_Saini @Jivraj

Sir the same issue occurred on my end as well. My endpoint is returning the correct output, as demonstrated by @SK76 . However, it has still been marked as 0.

Could you please check whether the evaluation is still in progress or has been finalized? I would appreciate any update on the status.

(54/57 questions working, tested with different values and parameters)

Roll num : 21f3001076

Thank you.
