**[Discussion Image by Nelson]** This image shows part of a spreadsheet, likely used in the "GA5 - Data Preparation" assignment. The spreadsheet has columns labeled "city," "product," and "sales," with data entered under each column. The "city" column contains variations of "Sao Paulo," including misspellings like "Sau Paulo," "Sao Pualo," and "Sao Paoulo" which need standardization during data preparation. The "product" column shows "Bacon" repeatedly, and the "sales" column contains numerical data representing sales figures; the last number, 2871, is likely the total for the column. Filter icons are visible next to the column headings, indicating that filtering is enabled on the data. This demonstrates the need for cleaning, standardizing, and summarizing data for the assignment.y", "product", and "sales" and the header row has filter icons enabled. The student seems to be working with a dataset where the product is consistently "Bacon". There are some variations in spelling for the city "Sao Paulo" such as "Sao Pualo" or "Sao Paoulo" indicating a potential data cleaning task related to inconsistent naming conventions. At the bottom of the sales column, the value "2871" appears, possibly representing a total or other calculation on the "sales" data." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="phZPOtY4a8VJ0RNQDMmtsh2Jdo" width="318" height="183">image318×183 5.46 KB
