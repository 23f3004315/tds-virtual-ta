[**[Course Image: 2025-02-07 Week 4 - Session 4 - TDS Jan 25]** This image introduces "Week 4, Session 4" of the TDS (presumably The Data Science) course content, held on February 7, 2025. Session 4 is designed to build upon the concepts and skills covered in the previous weeks. The visual elements hint at data analysis and visualization, suggesting the session's focus will be on these areas. Students can anticipate learning tools and techniques for interpreting and presenting data effectively. Week 4, Session 4 aims to equip students with a deeper understanding of data science methodologies.covered in Week 4, Session 4 of the TDS (likely The Data Science) course, specifically for the live session held on February 7, 2025. Week 4, Session 4 will likely address concepts, skills, or tools related to data science, as depicted by the various data-related icons (charts, graphs, networks, etc.) around the text. This session will likely build upon previously acquired knowledge from the earlier weeks of the course. By the end of this session, students are expected to deepen their understanding and application of core data science principles within their TDS projects and assignments. Students should review their knowledge from weeks 1-3 of the TDS course, to be adequately prepared for the material covered in this session.)](https://youtu.be/SiW-rcMk0Nk)

**Q1: How difficult are the TDS assignments?**

**A1:** The first assignment was easy, the second was hard, the third was average, and the fourth seems easy. However, the instructor notes that the first assignment was only easy for those with a technical background; for most students, it was very difficult. The difficulty level of subsequent assignments will decrease.

**Q2: Where can I find the recording of yesterday's session?**

**A2:** It's already uploaded to your calendar associated with your IIT-DS ID. It takes Google about an hour or two to process the video.

**Q3: How do I use the BBC Weather API to get weather data for a specific location?**
