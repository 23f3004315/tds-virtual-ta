## Correlation with Excel

[**[Course Image: Correlation with Excel]** This image shows how to create a scatter plot in Excel to visualize the correlation between two variables, in this case, "new_cases" and "new_deaths" for Brazil. The Excel sheet contains columns with data like country, date, and the number of new cases and deaths. A scatter plot is generated showing the relationship between these two variables, and a trendline is added to the plot to visually assess the strength and direction of the correlation. Correlation coefficients are calculated in cells H4 and I5, showing the correlation between "new_deaths" and "new_vaccinations". Students can apply this knowledge to explore the relationship between different variables in their own datasets, such as in TDS projects where they need to analyze correlations within their data.ualize the correlation between two variables in Excel using a scatter plot and trendline. To create the plot, the data for "new_cases" and "new_deaths" are selected, then a scatter plot is inserted from the "Insert" tab. After the chart is created, a trendline is added to visually represent the correlation, offering insights into the relationship between these variables. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients between "new_deaths" and "new_vaccinations" (0.28855) and "new_deaths" with itself (1) are shown in the Excel sheet, indicating the strength and direction of the relationships. By examining the plot and the correlation coefficients, one can infer how changes in one variable relate to changes in the other, which is a fundamental concept in correlation analysis.)](https://youtu.be/lXHCyhO7DmY)
