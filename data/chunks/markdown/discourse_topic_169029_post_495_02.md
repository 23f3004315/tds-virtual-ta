**[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image captures a student's interaction with the Azure Virtual Machine serial console while troubleshooting their TDS solver project. The student is attempting to restart the Nginx server using `sudo systemctl restart nginx`, but encounters a "sudo: command not found" error, indicating an issue with the sudo configuration or path. Subsequently, they attempt to reload the daemon, start Uvicorn, and enable Uvicorn using systemctl commands, and the output shows that Uvicorn service is running, specifically that the `uvicorn.service` is loaded, enabled and active. The console output also displays Uvicorn startup messages, including warnings about ffmpeg not being found and informational messages showing the application startup process. The code snippet on the top left shows the `process_request` function definition within the FastAPI application, taking a question and optional file as input.onfirms that Uvicorn is running and listening, logging messages related to server startup and a warning about ffmpeg not being found.

The student, "shashi," is attempting to restart Nginx and manage the Uvicorn service. The commands entered include `sudo systemctl restart nginx`, which results in a "sudo: command not found" error, and a sequence of systemctl commands to daemon-reload, start, and enable Uvicorn. The terminal output confirms that the `uvicorn.service` is loaded, enabled, and actively running since April 14, 2025. The output also displays Uvicorn FastAPI server logs, including warnings about "Using low precision" and "Couldn't find ffmpeg." The console shows that the Uvicorn server is running successfully despite the warnings., **[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image depicts a student's interaction with the Azure Serial Console for their TDS project, showcasing a troubleshooting session for their Uvicorn FastAPI server. The student is attempting to restart Nginx and then starts, enables, and checks the status of Uvicorn using `systemctl` commands, but encounters a "sudo: command not found" error, indicating an issue with permissions or the `sudo` package installation. After that, the commands to start and enable Uvicorn seem to run successfully, with the Uvicorn service reported as "active (running)." The console output also displays log messages from Uvicorn, showing the server starting and indicating a potential issue with finding ffmpeg. Finally, the log shows "Uvicorn running on ht" which indicates the uvicorn server has started. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image shows a student's terminal output in the Azure portal serial console, likely during the TDS project 2 troubleshooting. The student is attempting to restart `nginx` and manage the `uvicorn` service using `systemctl` commands. An error "sudo: command not found" indicates a problem with the PATH or sudo configuration, suggesting the user may not have sufficient permissions, or the `sudo` command isn't installed/configured properly. Following the failed `nginx` restart, the student attempts to reload the daemon, start uvicorn, and enable uvicorn to start on boot, indicated by the chain of `systemctl` commands. The output confirms that the `uvicorn.service` is loaded, enabled, and actively running, along with related logs showing the FastAPI server startup process. 2x" data-dominant-color="4F5458">vm start1917Ã—1077 110 KB
