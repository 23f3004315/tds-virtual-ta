 students to do so in post #546. The "See billing documentation" link provides access to further information on Codespaces billing policies. 2x" data-dominant-color="151920">Screenshot 2025-02-16 0913411315×404 24.2 KB

**[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image from a student's post in the TDS discussion thread shows a Codespaces usage report, indicating a potential issue with resource limits. The "Usage hours" section displays "120.00 of 120.00 included core hours used", with a red bar indicating the student has exhausted their included core hours for the current period. The student also displays storage usage as "1.46 of 15.00 included GB-month used". The display indicates the current cost for usage hours and storage is $0.00. The text also states that "Included quotas reset in 13 days. See billing documentation." This is likely the source of a student question regarding how to manage Codespaces usage and avoid unexpected charges or interruption of their development environment.and shows the student asking about the resource limitations and what happens when they run out." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-16 091101" data-base62-sha1="qusb7PKn6Irl2dNw3ZkKyEdnhHW" width="690" height="149" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image depicts a student's GitHub Codespaces usage metrics, likely shared in the discussion thread to illustrate a problem or question about resource consumption. The Codespaces section shows the student has exhausted their included usage hours (120.00 of 120.00) while using only 1.46 GB of the 15.00 GB available for storage, with 13 days remaining until the quota resets. The "Usage hours" bar is filled entirely and colored red, visually indicating complete consumption of the included hours. The cost for both usage hours and storage is currently $0.00. This post would likely be related to a student inquiry about managing or understanding Codespaces resource limits within the LLM automation agent project., **[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image shows a student posting their Codespaces usage and quotas from a course project. The student has exhausted their included usage hours, showing "120.00 of 120.00 included core hours used," indicated by a red bar filling the usage hours section. The storage used is only "1.46 of 15.00 included GB-month used," indicated by a blue bar showing nearly full quota. A notification states "Included quotas reset in 13 days. See billing documentation," which possibly prompts the student's question. The discussion is likely centered around understanding how to manage or extend Codespaces resources when the initial allowance is used up, and how that relates to any billing or course policy. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image likely accompanies a student question within the discussion thread. It shows the Codespaces usage quota for a student, indicating that they have used 120.00 of 120.00 included core hours. A red bar visually reinforces that the usage has reached the limit. The student has also used 1.46 of 15.00 included GB-month of storage, with a blue bar showing the current storage usage. Since the "Usage hours" is maxed out, this student will likely inquire about solutions to avoid overage costs or learn how to optimize Codespaces usage for the remaining time until the quota resets in 13 days. 2x" data-dominant-color="16181F">Screenshot 2025-02-16 0911011351×292 13.3 KB
