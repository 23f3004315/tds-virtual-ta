Hi sir @carlton @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj @s.anand

I need your immediate attention regarding my project-2, as I received zero marks, but my server is running completely fine. Below are the key points that I need you to look into:

**Server is running and reachable. and Giving Correct Answers**

**GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code**, both return **200 OK**.

**Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people** – all received correct results.

**No issues seen in logs or deployment** – everything was set up properly.

**Others in my group got full marks** – we worked on the same project.

**I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation.**

**I’ve spent weeks working on this project**, including sleepless nights.

**This is my last term** – if I fail, I will have to repeat the entire diploma.

Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify:

**API Documentation:** FastAPI - Swagger UI
**API Endpoint:** http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api

I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that.
