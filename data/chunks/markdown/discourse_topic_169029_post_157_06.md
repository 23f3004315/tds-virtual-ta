**[Discussion Image by lakshaygarg654]** This image depicts a student's code within a discussion thread related to a project involving a TDS Solver, specifically Project 2. The code defines a JSON object named `my_response` that contains a key "answer" holding a Python script as a string. This script is intended to import `httpx` and `json`, define a function `analyze_sentiment` to interact with the OpenAI API for sentiment analysis, setting up API URL, headers including an authorization token, and the request data with "system" and "user" roles to instruct the model, and finally extracts sentiment analysis results. The script further executes the `analyze_sentiment` function within a `try...except` block and prints either the sentiment result or any error encountered. The outermost print statement attempts to extract and print the value associated with the "answer" key in `my_response`. The use of newline characters `\n` within the string suggests the student might be struggling with formatting or executing this embedded script correctly.he script imports `httpx` and `json`, then defines an `analyze_sentiment` function that interacts with the OpenAI API. It constructs a JSON payload with the API endpoint, headers (including a placeholder API key), a GPT-4o-mini model specification, and a message array with system and user roles to analyze sentiment. The code then attempts to extract and print the result using `response.json()`, and includes error handling. The outermost layer prints the "answer" from the `my_response` variable, which will output the entire raw script string, not the result of executing the code within the string. The student's code includes literal newline characters `\n` within the string, indicating they may not be correctly structuring multi-line strings or JSON payloads." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="zonpxeZTAwLGRrYTaysFCNCHAqZ" width="690" height="333" data-dominant-color="F2EBEB">image984Ã—476 19.7 KB
