**[Discussion Image by 23f2000573]** This image depicts part of an interactive coding exercise within the TDS "GA4 - Data Sourcing" module. Specifically, it relates to "Enabling CORS" by configuring the web application to include appropriate CORS headers, allowing GET requests from any origin. The prompt asks for the URL of the API endpoint; the student has entered "http://127.0.0.1:8000", which the system validates as "Correct" using a green checkmark. The system informs the user that it will check the endpoint by sending a request to this URL with "?country=..." to test the CORS configuration by passing different countries. A "Check" button is shown below to initiate the validation process. parameter "?country=..." to test the handling of different countries. A "Check" button is available for the student to initiate the validation process." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="6cKgXpuooCamFvAD5tyeXjBrWWp" width="690" height="184" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2000573]** This image shows a step-by-step instruction within an assignment related to enabling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). It prompts the student to configure their web application to include appropriate CORS headers, enabling GET requests from any origin. The UI element asks for the URL of the API endpoint, and the example response "http://127.0.0.1:8000" is marked as "Correct." The instruction also states that the system will check the URL by sending a request with a `?country=` parameter, using different country values. The final step requires the student to click the "Check" button to proceed., **[Discussion Image by 23f2000573]** This image shows a correct answer to a task asking for the URL of the API endpoint, which is `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The task is about enabling CORS by configuring the web application to include the appropriate CORS headers to allow GET requests from any origin. The system indicates that the given URL is "Correct" and that it will be checked by sending a request to the URL with a `?country=` parameter, passing different countries. There is a "Check" button at the bottom that the user would presumably click to proceed with this automated check. This appears to be an interactive exercise where the system validates the student's API endpoint URL and tests CORS configuration. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2000573]** This image captures part of a TDS student's work in progress during a GA4 Data Sourcing discussion. The task, "Enabling CORS", requires configuring a web application to include the appropriate CORS headers to allow GET requests from any origin. The student is prompted to enter the URL of their API endpoint, and "http://127.0.0.1:8000" has been entered and validated as "Correct". The system indicates it will verify this configuration by sending requests to the given URL, appending a "country" parameter with different country values to test the CORS implementation. Finally, a "Check" button is visible, likely to trigger further automated testing or validation of the CORS setup. 2x" data-dominant-color="272B30">image1765Ã—472 29.1 KB
