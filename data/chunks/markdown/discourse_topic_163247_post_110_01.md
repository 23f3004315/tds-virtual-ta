**[Discussion Image by Khushii]** This image captures a student's attempt to solve an LLM task in TDS Jan 2025 GA3, showing the coding environment and an error message. The task involves using the "gpt-4o-mini" model to analyze sentiment (GOOD, BAD, NEUTRAL) and requires specific API key and message formatting. The student's code includes a "DATA" dictionary with "model" and "messages" keys, containing a "system" role and a "user" role with provided text. The error message "The user message must be..." indicates a mismatch between the expected input text and the actual text provided in the "content" field of the "user" message, likely due to a copy-paste error or typo. The student needs to ensure the text in the user message exactly matches the required input.ZK," which suggests a mismatch in the expected versus actual user message content, specifically capitalization or character difference near the end of the string. The instructions state that the user message must be exactly the text contained above, indicating the need for precise string matching." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-05 at 8.07.34 PM" data-base62-sha1="yGJXqwyV1gasQznp2gjpPyPr2uZ" width="690" height="448" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Khushii]** This image captures a student's attempt to answer a question on the TDS platform, specifically related to the GA3 Large Language Models assignment, evidenced by the "TDS 2025 Jan GA3 - Large" tab. The instructions state that the student must use "gpt-4o-mini" and ensure correct formatting when prompting the LLM to analyze sentiment. The student has provided a JSON payload for the "DATA" variable, which includes a system message prompting the sentiment analysis and a user message with text to be analyzed. An error message appears below the code block stating "The user message must be N PlxDC6t EXfymcIF e K x1XTpIULdX t6H LTa YGZk, not N PlxDC6t EXfymcIF e K x1XTpIULdX t6H LTa YGZK," revealing a discrepancy in the expected user message content, likely due to case sensitivity or an exact match requirement of the challenge. The student's confusion stems from not providing the exact text in the user message as the question requires., **[Discussion Image by Khushii]** This image shows a student's attempt to complete a task in the "TDS Jan 2025 GA3 - Large Language Models" assignment, specifically related to using `gpt-4o-mini` for sentiment analysis. The instructions require passing an authorization header, using `gpt-4o-mini` as the model, including a system message for sentiment analysis with categories (GOOD, BAD, NEUTRAL), and ensuring the user message matches specific text exactly. The student's code defines a `DATA` dictionary containing the model name and messages, but an error is flagged: "The user message must be N PIxDC6t EXfymcIF e K x1XTpIULdX t6H LTa YGZK, not N PIxDC6t EXfymcIF e K x1XTpIULdX t6H LTa YGZK," indicating a mismatch in the text expected versus the text provided, likely a minor typo or case sensitivity issue. The "Check" button suggests this is an interactive coding exercise, and the error message indicates that the user message needs to be reviewed and corrected for the exact expected text. The student likely needs to carefully compare the prompt's required user message to their entered message and fix any discrepancies. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Khushii]** This image shows a student's attempt to complete a question in the "GA3 - Large Language Models" assignment, likely a peer discussion thread focusing on troubleshooting. The student is trying to use the `gpt-4o-mini` model with a system message instructing sentiment analysis, and a user message containing a specific text string. However, an error message indicates a mismatch in the user message, stating "The user message must be N PIxDC6t EXfymclF e K x1XTpIULdX t6H LTa YGZk, not N PIxDC6t EXfymcIF e K x1XTpIULdX t6H LTa YGZK," pointing to a likely typo or case sensitivity issue. The visible instructions specify the use of a dummy `httpx` library with `get` and `post` methods. To resolve the error, the student should double-check and correct the user message text string for any discrepancies. 2x" data-dominant-color="283032">Screenshot 2025-02-05 at 8.07.34 PM1920Ã—1249 138 KB
