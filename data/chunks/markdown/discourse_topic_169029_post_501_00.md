## Post #501 by 22f3000585

Sir, I too had provided render API and my logs do not show that it was accessed during the evaluation period. I had submitted the link in the form which was provided to update the link as i had not received any mail that my project had been evaluated before that.

Due to this, my score stands 0 as of now.

Sir, can you please look into this. Thank you
