## Parsing JSON

JSON is everywhere—APIs, logs, configuration files—and its nested or large structure can challenge memory and processing. In this tutorial, we'll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently.

For example, we'll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object.

[**[Course Image: JSON Parsing in Python]** This module focuses on using Python scripts to analyze data from JSON APIs and sort the results for efficient processing of large log files. The learning objective is to equip you with the skills to extract, manipulate, and order data from JSON responses, which is essential for tasks like identifying trends or debugging web service issues. You'll learn how to parse JSON data using Python's `json` library, extract relevant fields, and apply sorting algorithms to organize the information for better analysis, particularly within the context of multi-gigabyte log files. This knowledge is applicable to TDS projects involving data extraction and analysis from web services where you need to efficiently process and sort JSON data. By the end of this module, you should be able to write Python scripts that can automatically fetch data from APIs, parse the JSON responses, and sort the results based on specific criteria.g a Python script to analyze JSON APIs and sort the results, a crucial skill when dealing with web service log files in TDS. You'll learn how to extract meaningful data from JSON formatted responses and then organize this information for easier interpretation. The key takeaway is mastering the ability to write Python code that automatically fetches, parses, and sorts JSON data, which can significantly improve your data analysis workflow. Understanding how to work with APIs and JSON data is essential for many TDS projects, especially when dealing with external data sources or services. This ensures that you can effectively process and utilize the log data generated by the web service in a structured way.)](https://youtu.be/1lxrb_ezP-g)

This requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don't fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing:
