**[Discussion Image by akashkunwar]** This image depicts a question posed to TDS students in the "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]" course, specifically related to a "Weather Data Integration for AgroTech Insights" project. The task involves using the BBC Weather API to fetch weather forecasts for Manila, extracting the issue date and enhanced weather description, and then creating a JSON object with the issue date as the key and the corresponding weather description as the value. The image shows an example of the desired output format, and the student is asked to provide the JSON weather forecast description for Manila. The provided student answer suggests a consistent forecast of "Sunny and a gentle breeze" for the dates 2025-02-16 through 2025-02-20, and includes a "Check" button to submit the answer. exercise instructions detail using API keys, locales, and locationId parameters to fetch and process weather data, likely requiring iterations through forecast arrays to create the expected JSON output." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="i5tEVapQuiJs5y7GJ3PeatDKDAw" width="589" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by akashkunwar]** This image depicts a student's attempt to answer a question in the TDS "GA4 - Data Sourcing" course, specifically concerning weather data integration for AgroTech Insights. The task involves using the BBC Weather API to fetch weather forecasts for Manila, retrieve data using location IDs, and transform the data into a JSON object with "issueDate" as keys and "enhancedWeatherDescription" as values, as exemplified by the given output format. The student provides a JSON object forecasting the weather for Manila from "2025-02-16" to "2025-02-20", describing each day as "Sunny and a gentle breeze". They then click the "Check" button to submit their answer for evaluation, indicating an attempt to complete the assigned task., **[Discussion Image by akashkunwar]** This image shows a student exercise prompt and a student-provided solution related to weather data integration using the BBC Weather API within the TDS Jan 2025 course. The exercise tasks the student with fetching weather data for Manila, including retrieving the city's `locationId` and then using that ID to get the forecast data. The student must then extract `issueDate` and `enhancedWeatherDescription` from the API response to create a JSON object mapping each date to its weather description. The provided example output shows the expected JSON format, and the student's solution presents a JSON object with forecasts for Manila between "2025-02-16" and "2025-02-20", which all describe the weather as "Sunny and a gentle breeze". The "Check" button suggests the student can submit the response for evaluation. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by akashkunwar]** This image depicts an interactive exercise within the TDS "GA4 - Data Sourcing" course where students are tasked with integrating weather data using the BBC Weather API. The instructions outline a three-step process: API integration to fetch weather data for Manila, data extraction to retrieve forecast data using the location ID, and data transformation to extract the issue date and enhanced weather description, ultimately creating a JSON object. An example of the expected output format, mapping dates to weather descriptions is provided. The prompt asks the user to input the JSON weather forecast description for Manila, and the user provides a sample with the date "2025-02-16" to "2025-02-20" and the description "Sunny and a gentle breeze". A "Check" button indicates the user can submit their answer for evaluation. 2x" data-dominant-color="282B30">image1358Ã—1151 179 KB
