**[Discussion Image by Jayeshbansal]** This image is a screenshot showing a student's Python code and an error message within the TDS discussion forum. The code includes a `for` loop iterating through words, calculating dot products of embeddings using `np.dot`, appending the result to `dot_product_df`, and returning the maximum dot product. A `print` statement aims to display results with the prompt "I experienced issues during checkout," followed by a list of numerical values. The error message "TypeError: Z.runPython(..)tols is not a function" indicates a problem with a function call within the execution environment, likely related to how the code is being run in the context of the TDS platform's Python interpreter. This suggests a potential environment configuration or library version issue causing the `Z.runPython` function to not be recognized, hindering the correct execution of the submitted code.nment or library setup for running the python code within the TDS environment." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="8ObkI5jIITh10uQzH8KCnVNtzd2" width="690" height="124" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Jayeshbansal]** This image shows a student's Python code attempt and the error they encountered during a "GA3 - Large Language Models" assignment. The code attempts to calculate dot products of embeddings within a loop and find the maximum dot product. The student is printing the result of the `most_similar` function with the query "I experienced issues during checkout.", followed by a list of numbers which appears to be the output or intermediate results. The code produces a `TypeError: Z.runPython(..)tols is not a function`, indicating a problem with how the `Z.runPython` function is being called or that `tols` is not defined or available within its scope; potentially an issue with the environment setup. The error prevents the code from executing correctly, causing confusion regarding calculating the correct similarity scores., **[Discussion Image by Jayeshbansal]** This image shows a student's attempt to write Python code, likely related to processing embeddings and finding the most similar sentence based on "I experienced issues during checkout." The code includes a nested loop, calculating the dot product of embeddings and appending it to `dot_product_df`, then returning the maximum dot product value. The student is using `np.dot` to calculate the dot product and attempting to find the "most similar" sentence. However, the code throws a `TypeError: Z.runPython(...).toJs is not a function`, indicating a problem with the runtime environment, possibly related to how the code is executed within the learning platform's JavaScript environment and the integration with Python. The student is facing a technical error in the learning environment, not directly related to the Python logic itself. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Jayeshbansal]** This image shows a student's Python code in a discussion thread, related to calculating document similarity using embeddings. The code iterates through "words," calculates the dot product of embeddings, and attempts to find the maximum dot product to identify the most similar text. The code includes a print statement to output the most similar text related to the phrase "I experienced issues during checkout," along with a list of numerical values. However, the code throws a `TypeError: Z.runPython(...).toJs is not a function`, indicating an issue with how the Python code interacts with the Javascript environment, likely a problem in the execution environment or with library compatibility rather than the Python logic itself. The error message appears to originate from the runtime environment of the coding platform being used in the discussion. 2x" data-dominant-color="767679">image1677Ã—303 30.6 KB
