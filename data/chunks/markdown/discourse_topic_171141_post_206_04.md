, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project **naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates)** and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate.

---

To clarify, **all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29**, **after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out.** Furthermore, we were **never informed** that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it.
My only request is that if my **updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated** due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my **original P1 eval score could be reinstated** instead of receiving a **0**—since it was already evaluated and graded.

Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard @carlton @Jivraj
