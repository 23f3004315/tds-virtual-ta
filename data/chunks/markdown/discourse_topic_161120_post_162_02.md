**[Discussion Image by 24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ]** The image shows a student, 24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ, submitting a Graded Assignment on the TDS Jan 2025 course platform, specifically "GA2 - Deployment Tools - Discussion Thread." The student is prompted to publish a GitHub Page showcasing their work, ensuring their email address, `24ds1000121@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`, is included in the page's HTML, obfuscated using Cloudflare's email protection. The student has entered `https://ulagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/?v=1, ?v=2` as the GitHub Pages URL, but upon checking, an error message appears: "Error: `24ds1000121@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` is not in the response". The HTML source code of the student's page is shown, and it appears the email address is obfuscated using Cloudflare's email protection, but the checker isn't recognizing this. The instructions also mention using `?v=1, ?v=2` to bust the cache if recent changes are not reflected. The student's issue is that the automated checker is not recognizing the Cloudflare-protected email within the published GitHub Page.t detecting the original, de-obfuscated email address. The instructions suggest busting the cache by adding `?v=1, ?v=2` to the URL if recent changes aren't reflected, indicating awareness of potential caching issues affecting the submission. The student needs to ensure the de-obfuscated email address is correctly present when the page is rendered for the assignment to be properly validated." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="7FgQJvDjGZvfVVgnrOok292n7Tq" width="690" height="431" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ]** The image shows a student, 24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ, submitting a GitHub Pages URL for a graded assignment in the TDS Jan 2025 course. The assignment requires them to publish a GitHub Pages site containing their email address, obfuscated using Cloudflare's email protection, and included inside `` tags. The student's submitted URL is `https://ulagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/?v=1,?v=2`. The submission fails because the email address `24ds1000121@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` is not found in the HTML response, and the error message shows the actual HTML received from the submitted URL which does not seem to contain the obfuscated email as per the instructions. The page's HTML appears to have standard elements (DOCTYPE, head, body, title, and heading) and includes a Cloudflare email decoding script. The assignment instructions at the bottom of the form indicate how to bust the cache if recent changes are not reflected., **[Discussion Image by 24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ]** This image captures a student's attempt to answer a question on the TDS Jan 2025 GA2 assignment, specifically about GitHub Pages URLs. The instructions require the student to publish a page with their email address obfuscated using Cloudflare, and then provide the URL to that page. The student, 24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ, enters `https://ulagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/?v=1, ?v=2` as their answer, but receives an error message stating that the email address `24ds1000121@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` is not found in the response HTML. The HTML response shown in the error message includes obfuscated email details using Cloudflare's email protection mechanism, which may be the source of the student's confusion, but the check likely expected a direct match. The error message also suggests adding `?v=1, ?v=2` to the URL to bypass the cache if a recent change isn't reflected. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ]** The image shows a student, 24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ, attempting a graded assignment in "GA2 - Deployment Tools" on the TDS Jan 2025 course. The task requires publishing a GitHub Pages site with a specific email address included in the HTML, obfuscated using a given format. The student is attempting to validate the URL of their GitHub Pages site: "https://ulagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/?v=1, ?v=2". However, the check fails, producing the error: "24ds1000121@ds.study.iitm.ac.in is not in the response". The provided HTML snippet suggests the email is present but obfuscated using Cloudflare's email protection. The instructions mention adding "?v=1, ?v=2" to the URL to bust the cache if recent changes aren't reflected. The student may be facing an issue with either the obfuscation format or the presence of the email in the live HTML content due to caching or incorrect implementation. 2x" data-dominant-color="BFC2C0">image1920×1200 137 KB
