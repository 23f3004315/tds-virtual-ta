## Post #284 by 23f2002592

**Direct Link**: [Post #284](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/164277/284)

For as task description like this

Write the # of Thursdays in `/data/extracts.txt` into `/data/extracts-count.txt`

I have given the prompt in such detail to the LLM but it is still not able to understand the task because of the “#” symbol. The task is getting truncated even before it reaches to the LLM.

Can anyone help me on this because I have tried so many things to fix this but nothing seems to help.
