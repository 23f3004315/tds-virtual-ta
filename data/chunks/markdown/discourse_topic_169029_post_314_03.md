They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically.

This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting.

The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs… with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning.

Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers.

If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.
