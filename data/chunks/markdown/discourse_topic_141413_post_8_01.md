 alternate paths to a decent grade (like extra assignments for 10-20 marks in lieu of the loss of marks above mentioned ROE).

I would like to reiterate that my observations above are only w.r.t. a standard grading bell curve for all subjects or for TDS from previous terms.

Do note that all IITs follow normalization of marks and grades as a standard activity so that students can focus on learning and giving it their best rather than worrying about grades. This is not the case in this course, so we should think about alternative grading patterns without compromising on the rigour of the course in any way.
