## Post #545 by 22f3000819

@carlton @Jivraj I am making this post because I didn’t get reply to my post on the same matter.

Please check it out. My app can remain deployed only till April 18th. In the Cloud Run logs, I do see some multiple POST requests made today with 200 response but I’m not sure whether it was the TDS team doing a re-evaluation or someone else.

Also, are there any updates on this bug in project 1 in datagen.

Thanks.

Regards,

Shivaditya
