 line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location

and run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name.

It even happened for me

**[Discussion Image by Jaideep]** This image depicts a student, Jaideep, encountering an "externally-managed-environment" error while trying to install the numpy package using pip3. The system indicates that the environment is managed externally, likely by the OS package manager, and suggests using `pacman -S python-xyz` or creating a virtual environment with `python -m venv`. Jaideep then activates a virtual environment using `source /home/jaideep/python3/bin/activate` and attempts to install numpy again, which succeeds as numpy is already satisfied in the virtual environment's site-packages. This shows Jaideep successfully resolving the initial installation error by using a virtual environment.hin the activated virtual environment. Thus, the error was resolved by using a virtual environment to manage package installations." alt="Screenshot_20250215_143357" data-base62-sha1="37CTgqCCMcH8aqhG6ZxcO9HICyE" width="690" height="181" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Jaideep]** This image captures a student's troubleshooting process related to installing the 'numpy' package in a Python environment, showing both the error encountered and the subsequent resolution. The student, "Jaideep," initially faced an "externally-managed-environment" error when using `pip3 install numpy`. The system message advised using `pacman -S python-xyz` for system-wide installations or creating a virtual environment with `python -m venv path/to/venv`. The student then activated a Python virtual environment using `source /home/jaideep/python3/bin/activate` and retried `pip install numpy`, which this time indicated "Requirement already satisfied," suggesting the package was successfully installed within the virtual environment. This indicates a peer discussion of a technical issue with a positive outcome, showing a common installation issue and the correct virtual environment workaround., **[Discussion Image by Jaideep]** This image captures a student, Jaideep, troubleshooting a Python package installation issue in an Arch Linux environment. Initially, the command `pip3 install numpy` results in an "externally-managed-environment" error, indicating the environment is managed by the system's package manager. The terminal output suggests using `pacman` for system-wide installs, creating a virtual environment (`python -m venv`), or using `pipx` for application installations. Jaideep then activates a Python 3 virtual environment using `source /home/jaideep/.python3/bin/activate` and retries the `pip3 install numpy` command, which then succeeds because numpy is already satisfied within the activated virtual environment. This demonstrates a student encountering a common Python environment issue and resolving it by utilizing a virtual environment. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Jaideep]** This image depicts a student (Jaideep) encountering an "externally-managed-environment" error when trying to install the `numpy` package using `pip3` on Arch Linux. The error message suggests using `pacman` to install system-wide packages, creating a virtual environment with `python -m venv`, or using `pipx`. To resolve this, the student activates a Python 3 virtual environment located at `/home/jaideep/.python3/bin/activate`, and then successfully runs `pip3 install numpy`, but receives a "Requirement already satisfied" message because the `numpy` package version 2.2.2 already exists within the virtual environment's `site-packages` directory. This suggests the student successfully overcame the initial "externally-managed-environment" by utilizing a virtual environment. 2x" data-dominant-color="282B2C">Screenshot_20250215_1433573841Ã—1009 237 KB
