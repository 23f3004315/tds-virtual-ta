**[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image shows a peer discussion where a student tests the error handling of the TDS solver API. The student is using a POST request to "https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/" with 'question' and 'file' parameters set in the 'form-data' body. They intentionally uploaded a zip file ("q-move-rename-files.zip") that does not contain a CSV file. As a result, the API returns a "400 Bad Request" error with the JSON response: `{"error": "No CSV file found in zip."}`. The student confirms that they got the expected error response, verifying the API's functionality. This demonstrates a case where the student validates error handling rather than reporting a problem.ror response, confirming that the TDS solver's error handling for missing CSV files within the provided zip is working correctly. This indicates a successful test and a verified understanding of the expected behavior in this scenario." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="tQ7F12N3rQiky1nh5d0QY9E3wzR" width="690" height="321" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image shows a student validating the TDS Solver's error handling by intentionally providing an invalid ZIP file that does not contain a CSV file. The student used a POST request to the "https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/" endpoint with 'form-data' containing a 'question' field (text) and a 'file' field (file upload). They uploaded the "q-move-rename-files.zip" to the 'file' field. The server correctly returned a 400 Bad Request with a JSON response: `{"error": "No CSV file found in zip."}`. The student notes they changed the zip file to one without a CSV and that the server returned the expected error. This confirms correct error detection and response by the TDS Solver API., **[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image captures a student's testing and validation of the TDS solver API using Postman, demonstrating a successful error case. The student sent a POST request to `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` with "form-data" including a question and a zip file named `q-move-rename-files.zip` (confirmed by student to have no CSV). In the Postman "Body" section, the returned JSON response shows the expected error message `"error": "No CSV file found in zip."`, confirming the API's correct handling of the invalid input; the response code is 400 Bad Request. The student indicates they intentionally sent a zip file without a CSV file to verify the error handling. The student verified their implementation successfully generated a "No CSV file found in zip" error when the file uploaded did not contain a CSV file. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image captures a student's exploration of the TDS solver's API using a tool like Postman, and it documents expected behavior. The student made a POST request to `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` with `form-data`, including a "question" and a ZIP file, `q-move-rename-files.zip`. The student intentionally used a ZIP file that did *not* contain a CSV file, expecting an error, the student then confirmed that the API returned a 400 Bad Request error, specifically the JSON response `{"error": "No CSV file found in zip."}`. The student labeled the error, acknowledging that the API behaved as expected. This serves as a positive confirmation test case in the student's learning process. 2x" data-dominant-color="F9F7F7">image1942Ã—904 203 KB
