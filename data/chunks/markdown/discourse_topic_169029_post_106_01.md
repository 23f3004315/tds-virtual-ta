Did you get a solution for the Markdown question? I have the same issue.

**[Discussion Image by 22f3000819]** This image shows a student's submission for "Project 2 - TDS Solver." The submission is a report on step analysis and includes an introduction, a description of the data collection process, and a table showing the number of steps walked each day of the week. The submission also includes Python code for step analysis using the Pandas library, creating a DataFrame from the data and using the `.describe()` method. Further, there are observations, a comparison of steps with friends (Alice and Bob), suggestions for improvements, a URL for more information, and a section for visualization. The information is well-structured and uses Markdown syntax for headings and formatting.ction and comparison steps. Code snippets are present, using Python and the pandas library to analyze the data (`df = pd.DataFrame(data)` and `print(df.describe())`). The report also includes a table of steps walked, observations about the data (highest step count on Sunday), a comparison of step counts with friends (Alice and Bob), and suggestions for improvement with a link to a healthline article. The content indicates a student showcasing their work and its various components including code, visualizations, and results." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="i5CMkIlabzcuSBnE5peaaZXnqh7" width="690" height="300" data-dominant-color="313131">image892Ã—388 18 KB
