th at 9:11 pm IST** i.e *yesteday*, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations.

Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”]

**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image shows a file directory structure, likely from a student's submission for "Project 1" in a TDS (The Data Science) course, presented as part of a peer discussion about a failing grade despite the presence of a Dockerfile and image. The root directory contains files such as "Dockerfile", "LICENSE", "app.py", "datagen.py", "evaluate.py", "requirements.txt", "tasksA.py", and "tasksB.py", as well as a "__pycache__" directory and a folder named "LLM_PROJECT1". The student's confusion stems from the expectation that the Dockerfile would ensure a passing grade, highlighting a need for clarity on project evaluation criteria beyond Dockerfile presence. Troubleshooting will likely involve examining the Dockerfile's contents and confirming if the built image correctly executes all project requirements, including dependencies listed in "requirements.txt". The discussion likely focuses on whether the docker image actually runs the project successfully or if other grading criteria are not being met, beyond mere dockerization.rfile', 'LICENSE', 'app.py', 'datagen.py', 'evaluate.py', 'requirements.txt', 'tasksA.py', and 'tasksB.py'. There is also a '__pycache__' directory present. This image is used to provide context to the discussion, with the student likely trying to demonstrate the presence and location of necessary files for the project, suggesting that the project *should* have passed. Seeing the file structure can help others in the discussion identify potential problems, such as incorrect Dockerfile configuration, missing dependencies in `requirements.txt`, or any other project structure error." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="fahuMqTlIDS9GwNGNM399QrBKhJ" width="234" height="500" data-dominant-color="161A21">image250×534 3.92 KB
