Respected Sir,

I have submitted my project following all the guidelines and fulfilling all the prerequisites. My docker file is available publicly and it is present in the root directory of github repo, still the mail says that the file is missing and my score is zero. Can you please look into this issue

**[Discussion Image by Sujith_Sai]** This image depicts a student sharing the file structure of their TDS project to the discussion forum, likely seeking help to resolve versioning discrepancies or potential errors. The file structure contains common files such as `datagen.py`, `dockerfile`, `evaluate.py`, `requirements.txt`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`. Each file has an associated version (e.g., "v1", "docker updatae", "v1.1") and a timestamp indicating when it was last modified ("2 months ago"). The student is probably asking their peers or instructors if the shown files and corresponding versions are expected in the project. Understanding the correct file structure and versions is crucial for successful project execution.s include `datagen.py`, `dockerfile`, `evaluate.py`, `requirements.txt`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`. Version numbers or descriptions like "v1", "docker updatae", and "v1.1" are visible next to certain file names, possibly indicating the file's version or a note about its content. All files are indicated to be last updated "2 months ago," suggesting the student is revisiting older project files, potentially encountering discrepancies or versioning issues, as alluded to by the discussion title. This snapshot allows peers and instructors to understand the student's local file setup, facilitating targeted troubleshooting and version control guidance." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="7iIyskH9R9kGi1qOzu0xcMx25Mm" width="690" height="201" data-dominant-color="10141A">image1145Ã—334 7.28 KB
