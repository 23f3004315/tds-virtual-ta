**[Discussion Image by roy2003]** The image shows a student's view of an online quiz environment, likely related to the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" assignment in the TDS Jan 2025 course, including quiz instructions, recent saves, and the user's logged-in status. Below the quiz interface, the student is attempting to run the llama-cpp-android_llamafile model with k, and they are asking, "What is the nginx URL? It might look like: [random].ngrok.shrek.app". Displayed is the response data from an HTTP request to "https://103-76-42-164.ngrok-free.app", showing a large JSON object with fields like "result" containing various URLs, "type" set to "websocket" or "messenger", "anonymous" set to "true" or "false", and further details about web server configuration and data exchange formats, suggesting the student is attempting to access an application or service through a reverse proxy or tunnel for deployment or testing purposes. The instructions mention the quiz is "hackable," which might encourage students to inspect network requests and responses." that will give them access to the app data. The JSON response includes details about quiz questions, answers, and potentially other sensitive information that could be used to cheat." alt="Untitled design" data-base62-sha1="oampAABH1ku2lLO26O4lJ7tulNA" width="353" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by roy2003]** The image captures a student's interaction with an online quiz or assignment, specifically showing instructions, recent saves, and a request related to setting up a tunnel using ngrok, indicating a possible attempt to debug or analyze network traffic for the quiz. The instructions emphasize that the quiz is "hackable," suggesting students are encouraged to explore unconventional methods to find answers. The student is logged in and has recent save records, with scores displayed. The student is attempting to "Create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok" and the image asks "What is the ngrok URL? It might look like: [random].ngrok-free.app" The image includes a long JSON response that looks like the response of the llamafile server and could potentially be parsed to glean insights helpful for the quiz. This looks like a student attempting to apply the knowledge they've learned to the assignment., **[Discussion Image by roy2003]** This image shows a student asking a question about the ngrok URL as part of the GA2 deployment tools assignment in the TDS Jan 2025 course. The student is instructed to download Lamafile, run a specified Llamafile model, and create a tunnel using ngrok. An example ngrok URL is provided (https://[random].ngrok-free.app). The student attempted the URL format with their generated URL (https://0edd-103-76-82-164.ngrok-free.app), which resulted in an error: "Error: Response is not valid JSON". The page source code, visible below the error message, confirms the HTML structure. It is apparent the student is facing challenges with setting up ngrok correctly and understanding the expected URL format, thus seeking help on the discussion thread. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by roy2003]** This image captures a student's attempt to use `ngrok` and the resulting error. The student is instructed to download `Llamafile`, run the `Llama-3.2-18-Instruct.06.K.llamafile` model, create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using `ngrok`, and then provide the `ngrok` URL, which is expected to look like `https://[random].ngrok-free.app/`. The student enters `https://0ed0-103-76-82-164.ngrok-free.app` but receives the error "Error: Response is not valid JSON: ... Tunnel 0ed0-103-76-82-164.ngrok-free.app not found (ERR_NGROK_3200)". This error indicates that the provided `ngrok` tunnel URL is not active or is not properly forwarding traffic. 2x" data-dominant-color="5E6566">Untitled design1414Ã—2000 247 KB
