**[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image shows a student's Azure Virtual Machine serial console output in the context of troubleshooting the TDS Solver project. The student, "shashi," is attempting to restart nginx and manage the uvicorn service using `systemctl` commands. An error message "sudo: command not found" appears initially, indicating a problem with the command execution environment or user privileges. Subsequently, the console output displays the status of the uvicorn service as "active (running)," along with associated details like PID, memory usage, and startup logs, including a warning about "Couldn't find ffmpeg." The student is likely attempting to restart services to address issues within their deployed application.he application starting up and Uvicorn running." alt="vm start" data-base62-sha1="s1odVesi1v79FilEDSragX6paYZ" width="690" height="387" srcset="**[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image captures a student's interaction with the Azure virtual machine serial console while troubleshooting the TDS Solver project, specifically related to Uvicorn and Nginx. The student attempts to restart Nginx using `sudo systemctl restart nginx`, but encounters a "sudo: command not found" error. They then try to reload the system daemon, start Uvicorn, and enable it using a combined `sudo systemctl` command, which appears to partially succeed, indicated by the active (running) status of the `uvicorn.service`. Further down in the console output, Uvicorn logs messages indicating the server is started, an application startup occurs, and Uvicorn is running, along with warnings about "Couldn't find ffmpeg." The student is likely trying to deploy and run their FastAPI application using Uvicorn and is working through initial configuration errors related to missing system utilities and dependencies., **[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image captures a student's Azure VM serial console output, showing their troubleshooting steps for the TDS Solver project. The student attempts to restart nginx using `sudo systemctl restart nginx`, but encounters a "sudo: command not found" error, suggesting a potential issue with the sudo installation or configuration. Following this, they execute `sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl start uvicorn && sudo systemctl enable uvicorn`, which appears to successfully start the Uvicorn service, as confirmed by the subsequent `systemctl status uvicorn` output indicating the service is active and running. The console also displays Uvicorn startup logs, including warnings about "slow pure Python implementation" and the inability to find "ffmpeg or ffprobe", alongside informational messages confirming the server start and application startup. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image depicts a student's interaction with the Azure VM serial console, likely during Project 2, involving troubleshooting the TDS solver. The code snippet shows the FastAPI `process_request` function definition, indicating backend development. The student is attempting to restart Nginx using `sudo systemctl restart nginx`, which initially fails due to the "sudo: command not found" error. Subsequently, the student issues a series of commands to reload the daemon, start, and enable the Uvicorn service. The output shows Uvicorn is active and running, but there are warnings about a slow purifier and missing ffmpeg, and finally confirms the Uvicorn is running on the host. 2x" data-dominant-color="4F5458">vm start1917Ã—1077 110 KB
