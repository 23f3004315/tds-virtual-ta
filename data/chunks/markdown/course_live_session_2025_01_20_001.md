 it through a Google form. However, the course is designed to bridge the technical gap for non-technical participants, preparing them for industry standards. The instructors will provide support through dedicated sessions, and students are encouraged to use resources like ChatGPT and YouTube videos.

**Q3: What are the main components of the TDS project, and what tools are involved?**

---

**A3:** The TDS project has three main parts:

1. **GitHub:** For version control and code storage.
2. **Docker Hub:** For containerizing and deploying the application.
3. **LLM (Large Language Model):** For the core functionality of the application.
 The project involves using Fast API or similar frameworks to create the application, Podman to run the Docker image, and a form to submit the GitHub and Docker file details.

**Q4: How does the project accommodate participants from non-science or non-coding backgrounds?**

**A4:** The course aims to equip all participants, regardless of their background, with the necessary skills for the industry. It provides support through live sessions, encourages the use of external resources like ChatGPT and YouTube, and offers dedicated project sessions. The goal is to bridge the technical gap and prepare everyone for real-world challenges.

**Q5: How can I seek help or clarification on the project, especially if I find it overwhelming?**

**A5:** You can ask questions during the live sessions, utilize the course forum, or reach out to the instructors directly through the designated channels. Additionally, you can use resources like ChatGPT for assistance.

**Q6: What are the key tools and technologies used in the TDS project?**

**A6:** Key tools include Git for version control, GitHub for code hosting, Docker for containerization, Podman for running Docker images, and Fast API (or similar frameworks) for creating the application.

**Q7: How can I use VS Code for managing my Git repository?**

**A7:** VS Code has extensions that simplify Git operations. You can initialize a new Git instance, connect it to a remote GitHub repository, commit changes with messages, and manage branches all within the VS Code interface.

**Q8: How can I handle case-insensitive replacements in files using command-line tools?**

**A8:** You can use the `sed` editor with the `-i` option for in-place editing and the `I` flag for case-insensitive matching. You can combine this with `find` to locate and modify multiple files within a directory structure.

**Q9: How do I set up the connection between my local Git instance and a remote GitHub repository?**

**A9:** You can use the `git remote add origin ` command to establish the connection. You can find the specific URL on the GitHub repository page.
