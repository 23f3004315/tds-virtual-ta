## Post #244 by gouthamnischay

Thanks for the quick reply, i donâ€™t have a convincing argument to counter. Just a suggestion it would have been better if you have explicitly put in the sanity check requirements. Something so obvious to you might not be so for others.

if you are referring to this email even here, it was not explicit. Might have missed it in the gmeet. A mail would have been good.
