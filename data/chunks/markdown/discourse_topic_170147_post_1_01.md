Project 2:** There are multiple doubts posted in the *Project 2* discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? (thread link)

3. ROE Score Update

While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.

I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Lakshay
