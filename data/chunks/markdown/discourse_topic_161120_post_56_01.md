". The error message indicates a problem with the response from the server, specifically that the expected JSON format was not received but instead HTML content. This suggests that the ngrok tunnel might not be correctly configured, or that the Llamafile server is returning an unexpected error page rather than the API data. The error points to an issue rendering the page on exam.sanand.workers.dev with Cloudflare, and advises the website owner to login to Cloudflare and check error logs." data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/xdRAG6dY3fBXknQH4LBrBp8nZZm.jpeg?dl=1" title="Screenshot 2025-01-21 222055" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">**[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** The image depicts a student, GaURaVinDeX, in the TDS Jan 2025 cohort, encountering an error while trying to use an ngrok URL for a Llamafile deployment. The student asks "What is the ngrok URL? It might look like: https://[random].ngrok-free.app/", then provides their actual ngrok URL which results in the error "Error: Response is not valid JSON:". The content following "Error: Response is not valid JSON:" is primarily HTML markup, including indications of a Cloudflare error page with the title "Worker threw exception". The error suggests a problem with the website exam.sanand.workers.dev, which is behind the Cloudflare network, experiencing issues rendering the page. The instructions on the error page direct the website owner to log into Cloudflare to check the error logs.gging and instructs the website owner to check the error logs in Cloudflare." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-21 222055" data-base62-sha1="xdRAG6dY3fBXknQH4LBrBp8nZZm" width="690" height="343" srcset="**[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** In this student discussion, a student is trying to create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using `ngrok` and asks, "What is the ngrok URL?" providing `https://58e1-150-107-42-211.ngrok-free.app` as the URL they are using. The response shown in the image indicates an error: "Error: Response is not valid JSON: ..." followed by a large chunk of HTML, suggesting the ngrok URL is returning an HTML page indicating an error from `exam.sanand.workers.dev` and Cloudflare. The HTML indicates a Cloudflare error 1101, "Worker threw exception", and suggests the student login to Cloudflare and check error logs for `exam.sanand.workers.dev` if they are the owner of the website. This indicates a problem with the server-side application or configuration, rather than with ngrok itself., **[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** This image is a screenshot from a student discussion where the student is trying to create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok after downloading the Llamafile model. They ask what the ngrok URL should look like and then share their actual ngrok URL: `https://58e1-150-107-42-211.ngrok-free.app`. An error message is displayed stating "Error: Response is not valid JSON" along with HTML code suggesting a Cloudflare error page is being returned, indicating that the ngrok URL is not correctly proxying to the Llamafile server, and instead displays a "Worker threw exception" error from exam.sanand.workers.dev, which is served through Cloudflare. The student has encountered a problem connecting to the Llamafile server via the ngrok tunnel, as the URL returns a Cloudflare error page instead of valid JSON. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by GaURaVinDeX]** The student GaURaVinDeX is attempting to create an ngrok tunnel to serve the Llamafile model. The student posts the ngrok URL that they generated; however, the application returns the error "Response is not valid JSON." The error output contains an HTML document indicating a "Worker threw exception" and that "An unknown error occurred while rendering the page" on a Cloudflare network. The error suggests logging into Cloudflare and checking the error logs for exam.sanand.workers.dev. The student appears to be facing an issue with the ngrok setup or the Llamafile server, which is resulting in a response that is not valid JSON. 2x" data-dominant-color="F7F0F0">Screenshot 2025-01-21 2220551920Ã—957 262 KB
