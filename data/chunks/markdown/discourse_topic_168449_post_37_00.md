**[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image shows part of a user interface, specifically related to a completed assessment or quiz within the TDS platform. The assessment, indicated as having "Ended at Sun, 17 Nov, 2024, 2:00 pm IST", displays a "Score: 6/12", suggesting the student achieved half of the total possible points. Two buttons, "Check all" and "Save" are visible, giving the student options to review all answers or save current progress/state. This likely depicts a student reviewing their mock ROE (Rules of Engagement) assessment results and potentially preparing to save changes after reviewing. A score of "6/12" indicates the student received half marks. Buttons labeled "Check all" and "Save" suggest the student is reviewing answers. The overall context is the post-assessment review interface for mock ROE tests." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-26 205020" data-base62-sha1="uwBPAG6wx8xC1o1CW55vep0q9MJ" width="690" height="48" data-dominant-color="D24250">
