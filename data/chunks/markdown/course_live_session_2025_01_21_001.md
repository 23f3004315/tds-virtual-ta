; how deep you go is up to you. The biggest challenge is usually reading and understanding documentation. These sessions are designed to help you overcome that hurdle.

**Q2: What is the tool to create the API?**

**A2:** FastAPI. It will be demonstrated in this session.

**Q3: Will there be a review of the previous sessions?**

---

**A3:** Recordings are available on the YouTube playlist. Summaries are also available on the Tools in Data Science website (the last item on the page). The summaries were generated using AI, and the process is explained. An overarching summary may be added later, but not today.

**Q4: In the week 2 GA assignment, when using FastAPI, question 9 asks for an authentication tool from NGrok. After three uses, it says the limitation has expired. What can we do?**

**A4:** NGrok will be discussed in this session. The limitation is that you can only run one server or one tunnel at a time.

**Q5: In the GitHub Actions section, question 7 asks about creating a FastAPI webpage using GitHub. It seems to require a premium version. Is there a workaround?**

**A5:** You can do it without a premium version. The only time you might have an issue is if you're using Codespaces and run out of the 125-hour limitation. Students have free access to GitHub.

**Q6: What is the tool to create the API?**

**A6:** FastAPI.

**Q7: Are the scores from the initial check (9/10 or 10/10) final, or will they be evaluated after submission?**

**A7:** Whatever you last submitted is your final score.

**Q8: In GA1, question 2 says to submit only the JSON body, not the headers. But if I don't submit headers, it shows an error. What should I do?**

**A8:** This will be addressed toward the end of the session.

**Q9: When running UVicorn on WSL, there are no issues. But on Windows, it seems there's an issue with anti-something, some shielders, or something on my computer, flagging it and preventing it from running. What should I do?**
