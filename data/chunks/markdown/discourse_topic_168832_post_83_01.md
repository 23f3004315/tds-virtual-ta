 the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive.

There was a technical support meeting going between 1 Pm to 1:50 pm on ROE day, you were expected to join that meeting. You didn’t join technical support meet before deadline.

**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image, from a student discussion forum regarding a remote online exam, provides support contact information. It guides students with general questions to join the "Discourse" forum, which is restricted to IITM students. For technical issues, students have the option to join a Google Meet session, also limited to IITM students. Therefore, this helps resolve confusion points or blocks during the remote exam by providing clear support channels. The announcement is presented within a blue-bordered container.ourse forum, and those with technical issues to optionally join a Google Meet session. Both resources are indicated as being exclusively for IITM (Indian Institute of Technology Madras) students. This directs students to the correct support channels to resolve their issues during the exam period. The inclusion of "OPTIONAL" emphasizes that joining the Google Meet for technical issues is not mandatory, and the Discourse forum is for general questions." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="tfms7DXNnn3vL3RC3epq455Wtio" width="690" height="146" data-dominant-color="13363E">image1130×240 10.2 KB

Even on discourse we were continuously looking for new posts during ROE, you created discourse post at 2:3 PM which was after deadline so we can’t help with it.
