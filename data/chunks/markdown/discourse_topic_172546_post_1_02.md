**[Discussion Image by Sagan]** This image depicts a student question within the TDS (Tools in Data Science) student discussion forum, specifically about the "PYQ Haversine" problem, with the student seeking validation of their initial radian conversions for latitude and longitude in the context of the Haversine formula calculation. The image shows a quiz practice platform with a question menu and highlights question 1. The student has used ChatGPT, which provided a step-by-step guide for using the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two points. The student then asks if the converted radian values for latitudes and longitudes of two locations (A and B) look correct. The values provided are: φ1 (Latitude of Location A) = 0.7112 radians, λ1 (Longitude of Location A) = -1.2915 radians, φ2 (Latitude of Location B) = 0.7116 radians, and λ2 (Longitude of Location B) = -1.2914 radians. A) = 0.7112 radians, λ1 (Longitude of Location A) = -1.2915 radians, φ2 (Latitude of Location B) = 0.7116 radians, and λ2 (Longitude of Location B) = -1.2914 radians. The chatbot's response outlines the Haversine formula and its preparatory steps, including converting degrees to radians, calculating latitude/longitude differences, and applying the Haversine equation. The quiz platform shows question navigation buttons, with question #1 highlighted in green." alt="Screenshot (884)" data-base62-sha1="qNsJ9lnqvnyPQeMwALzzJDD2lTu" width="690" height="388" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Sagan]** The image depicts a student question within a TDS (Tools in Data Science) course discussion, specifically about the Haversine formula. The student is working on a practice quiz using a platform called "quizpractice.space," accessible via a web browser. The student posts a question after following steps outlined by ChatGPT on applying the Haversine formula, converting latitude and longitude for two locations into radians and computing the intermediate values. The student seeks confirmation that their converted latitude and longitude values (φ1, λ1, φ2, λ2) are correct before proceeding further with the Haversine formula calculation., **[Discussion Image by Sagan]** The image shows a student working through a Haversine formula problem on a quiz practice website, specifically question 24 out of 40, likely related to a TDS (Tools in Data Science) course. The student is in "Learning Mode" and has consulted with ChatGPT, which provides a step-by-step explanation including converting degrees to radians, calculating differences in latitude and longitude, and applying the Haversine formula itself. The student has converted the latitude and longitude coordinates for two locations (A and B) into radians and presents these values for review, asking "Does this look correct?". The coordinate values given are φ1 (Latitude of Location A) = 0.7112 radians, λ1 (Longitude of Location A) = -1.2915 radians, φ2 (Latitude of Location B) = 0.7116 radians, and λ2 (Longitude of Location B) = -1.2914 radians, indicating a possible confusion point in confirming the correctness of the converted values within the Haversine calculation. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Sagan]** This image depicts a student question posted within a TDS discussion forum, focused on the Haversine formula. A ChatGPT response outlines the steps for calculating the distance between two points using latitude and longitude, including converting to radians, calculating differences, and applying the formula. The student replies, stating they've converted latitude and longitude for two locations to radians and provides the values, seeking confirmation of their correctness. They present the calculated radian values for latitudes (φ1, φ2) and longitudes (λ1, λ2) of Locations A and B. The student's confusion revolves around verifying the accuracy of their radian conversions before proceeding with the Haversine formula. 2x" data-dominant-color="5D5C5B">Screenshot (884)1920×1080 134 KB
