Hello Sir @carlton @Jivraj

What are implications on missing the project 1.

Due to some personal reasons I wasn’t able to start any work on my project 1. It seems difficult for me to complete it.

Could you please tell what will be the implications of missing it. Will I in anyway be able to cover up and pass in the subject doing future assignments and projects?

Thank you

PS: This isn’t any request to extend dates. I accept my fault and respect the dates provided by the team.
