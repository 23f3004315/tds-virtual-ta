 the correct solution automatically
Especially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload
I’ve made it **free for the first 3 questions**
After that, students can access the full platform for just **₹199/month**, which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs

My Humble Request:
This is a tool I’ve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students.

To sustain the platform — hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration — I’ve introduced a small paid model after a free trial.

I would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement.

It’s built *by an IIT Madras student, for IIT Madras students* — with the sole goal of making their learning smoother, faster, and smarter.

Thank you so much for your time and support.

Warm regards,

It’s a tool built by a fellow IITM student, with deep respect for the academic rigor of this program — not to replace learning, but to accelerate it.

Please let me know if you’d like a walkthrough, or if any suggestions for improvements arise.
