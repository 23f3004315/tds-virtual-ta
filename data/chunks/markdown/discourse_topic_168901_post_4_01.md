**[Discussion Image by 22f1000120]** This image depicts a view from the "Source Control" panel in a code editor, likely VS Code, showing a Git history graph, suggesting a peer discussion or instructor demonstration about version control practices. The graph shows a series of commits, merge requests, and branches related to a project, with commits like "Added chardet code," "Rename README.txt.txt," and "Ilm code week-3" visible. The branch 'main' is highlighted, and there are indications of other feature branches, such as "painful-bug" and "23f2000573/ll...". The student posting this may be using the graph to understand commit history, merge operations, or branch management within the shared code repository, specifically regarding the "ROE Common Snippets Repo".. The view shows a series of commits and merge operations, including "Merge pull request #2 from de...", "Added chardet code to get file encoding", "Merge pull request #3 from 23f2000573/II...", "Rename README.txt.txt to README_LLM.tx...", and commits associated with various team members like "ritwiktrivedi." The visual representation indicates branching and merging of code, offering insights into the development workflow of the project, which centers on LLM (Large Language Model) development. The discussion likely revolves around code integration, resolving conflicts, or understanding the contribution history of different students, hence serving as a resource to provide context and solutions." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="enxPeq2kQrOaXna3jQIsczPnsI3" width="401" height="374">image401Ã—374 21 KB
