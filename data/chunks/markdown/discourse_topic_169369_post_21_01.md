 I had submitted before the time limit and also after the time limit after hacking it(wasn’t sure if it was allowed but decided to try it nevertheless)

I feel I should atleast receive the marks for which I had submitted within the time limit.

My roll number is 24F1001631.

The scores listed are in descending order, showing a student's progression through the quiz with different scores at different times, and this informs how students evaluate their progress in the TDS course.e of 9. The dashboard displays a history of the student's submissions and their respective scores, allowing them to track their progress on the quiz." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="2pJOqYPCgbp2x1Uvez5OQpWbXlf" width="690" height="122" srcset="**[Discussion Image by ItsMeAlex]** This image shows a student's view of their recent saves for a programming quiz within the TDS student dashboard.

The scores shown are 9, 8, and 6 from the most recent to the oldest save, and a parenthetical note indicates that the "most recent is your official score," guiding students to understand which score is the one that counts.
