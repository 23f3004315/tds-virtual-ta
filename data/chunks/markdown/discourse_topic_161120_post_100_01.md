The prompt asks "What is the API URL endpoint for FastAPI? It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api". The student entered "http://127.0.0.1:8000/ap" into a text field, which is highlighted in red indicating an error. The error message "TypeError: Load failed" appears below the field. The system indicates it will test the URL by sending a request to it with "?class=..." appended and check the response against expected data. The underlying issue is likely an incomplete URL entry, as the student's input ends prematurely.ent is encountering a problem with the provided URL, likely due to it being incomplete or unavailable, preventing the system from successfully loading data from it.

The student has entered "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api", but the system flags a "TypeError: Load failed," indicating a problem with accessing the provided URL. The system will attempt to validate the URL by appending "?class=..." and checking the response, implying an automated testing mechanism. The CORS note at the top highlights a potential reason for failure that the student may need to enable CORS in their backend to allow GET requests from any origin. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Adithya]** This image shows a student encountering an error while configuring the API URL endpoint for FastAPI in a deployment tool, likely as part of a TDS (Tech Development System) course assignment. The tool prompts the student to enter the API URL, suggesting the format `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. The student has entered this URL, but the tool displays a `TypeError: Load failed` error message, indicating a problem accessing the specified endpoint. The tool also mentions it will check the URL by sending a request with the `?class=` parameter. This suggests the student needs to troubleshoot why the API endpoint is not accessible, possibly due to CORS issues, the FastAPI server not running, or network connectivity problems. 2x" data-dominant-color="2C2C30">Screenshot 2025-01-29 at 10.08.58 PM2618×366 47 KB
