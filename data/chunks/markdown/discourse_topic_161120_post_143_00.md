Hi @24ds1000082_Vivek, @23f3004114 ,

You guys are not using correct format for response.

`{
 "students": [
 {
 "studentId": 1,
 "class": "1A"
 },
 {
 "studentId": 2,
 "class": "1B"
 }, ...
 ]
}
`
This is correct for which have a object with key `students` which is not present in your response.

kind regards
