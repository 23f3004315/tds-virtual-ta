## Post #7 by 22f3002933

**Direct Link**: [Post #7](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/171141/7)

I have noticed that my image was run on a `x86_64` architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is `ARM`. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error`.

This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.
