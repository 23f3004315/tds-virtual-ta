**[Discussion Image by 23f2003717]** This image shows a portion of a spreadsheet used for data preparation in the TDS Jan 2025 course. The columns displayed include 'Country (Normalised)' (all entries are "United Arab Emirates"), 'DATE', 'Product' (all entries are "Kappa"), 'Sales', and 'Cost'. The data shown is formatted in a tabular structure, with dates spanning from 2022 to 2023. The display includes headers with dropdown/filter icons enabled, suggesting this is likely within a spreadsheet program used for data analysis. This data snapshot could be shared by a student as a point of reference in the discussion thread, perhaps to illustrate a transformation or cleaning step.olumns: "Country (Normalized)", which shows only "United Arab Emirates"; "DATE" showing various dates formatted as YYYY-MM-DD or MM-DD-YYYY; "Product" showing only "Kappa"; "Sales" showing numerical sales data with decimal precision; and "Cost", similarly showing numerical cost data with decimal precision. The column headers have filter icons, indicating that the table can be filtered based on the column values. The data shown appears to be consistent, but the variety of date formats raises a question about potential data standardization tasks." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="rgA6d3McedAPIPkot41aLfre1GR" width="690" height="386" data-dominant-color="BDCBDB">image817Ã—458 29.3 KB
