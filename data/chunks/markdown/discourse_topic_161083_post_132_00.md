## Post #132 by 23f3001601

Hello Sir,

I am writing to bring to your attention a discrepancy I’ve noticed regarding my Week 1 graded assignment for the Tools in Data Science course.

I successfully completed the assignment and received a score of **80 out of 100**. However, when I checked the course portal, it is showing my status as “**absent**” for this particular assignment.

I wanted to ensure that this information is corrected in the system to accurately reflect my participation and performance. Could you please look into this matter and update my grade accordingly?
