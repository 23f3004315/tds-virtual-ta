**[Discussion Image by 23f1002574]** This image depicts a student question in the TDS Solver Project 2 discussion thread. The code shows the definition of a POST endpoint named "/tdsp2" using the `@app.post` decorator. The function `tdsp2` is defined with asynchronous execution using `async def`. It takes two parameters: `question`, a string obtained from a Form, which is required (`Form(...)`), and `file`, an optional file upload (`Optional[UploadFile]`) defaulted to None using `File(None)`. This snippet is likely part of a student's implementation that they are seeking guidance on, especially regarding the correct handling of form data and optional file uploads.dpoint to handle text input via a form and an optional file upload." alt="Screenshot 2025-04-14 224629" data-base62-sha1="rF7J8eTnLaHUl06FnntvTeL6tR3" width="690" height="53" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1002574]** This image depicts a snippet of Python code related to defining an API endpoint within a FastAPI application, as part of the TDS solver project. Specifically, it shows the definition of a POST endpoint at the "/tdsp2" route using the `@app.post` decorator. The asynchronous function `tdsp2` is defined to handle incoming requests, accepting `question` and `file` as parameters. The `question` parameter is defined as a string of type `Form` and the `file` parameter is defined as `Optional[UploadFile]` and defaults to `File(None)`. This function likely handles processing of text-based questions and optional file uploads., **[Discussion Image by 23f1002574]** This image represents a code snippet from a student question within the TDS Solver Project 2 discussion. It shows the definition of an asynchronous function `tdsp2` decorated with `@app.post("/tdsp2")`, which likely indicates an API endpoint for handling POST requests to the "/tdsp2" route. The function `tdsp2` takes two arguments: `question` of type string, which is acquired from the `Form` data, and `file` of type `Optional[UploadFile]`, with a default value of `File(None)`. The use of `Form(...)` suggests that the `question` parameter is a required field in the form data, and the `Optional[UploadFile]` type indicates that file uploads are optional. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1002574]** This image is a code snippet from a student discussion, likely a question about the TDS Solver project. The code defines an asynchronous function `tdsp2` decorated with `@app.post("/tdsp2")`, indicating a POST endpoint. The function accepts two parameters: `question` of type string, retrieved from a form, and `file` which is an optional uploaded file. `question` is a required parameter from the form, and `file` defaults to None if not provided. The code snippet presents the function signature with type hints, likely shared by a student encountering an issue or seeking clarification on parameter handling within the FastAPI endpoint. 2x" data-dominant-color="272828">
