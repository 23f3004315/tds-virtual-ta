## Automate machine learning with PyCaret

[**[Course Image: Automate machine learning with PyCaret]** This image illustrates the process of retrieving and displaying the training data configuration within a machine learning context, likely using a tool like PyCaret. The code `training_data = get_config('X_train')` demonstrates how to access the training dataset ('X_train') stored within the configuration. The output shows a tabular view of the training data, including various feature columns (ProbViewPRM, SpecialDWI_I, PriceRM, etc.) and their corresponding numerical values. Understanding how to extract and inspect the training data is essential for data exploration, validation, and debugging during the model building process. By using `get_config()`, the user gains access to crucial information about the dataset used for training.ess and view the `training_data` variable in a PyCaret environment, specifically within a Jupyter Notebook or similar interactive environment. The command `training_data = get_config('X_train')` retrieves the preprocessed training dataset, which is a crucial step after feature engineering or data preparation within a machine learning pipeline. By displaying the `training_data`, you can inspect the features and their values that will be used to train your model, ensuring data quality and understanding the input for your machine learning algorithms. This step allows for verification that data preprocessing steps, such as feature selection or scaling, have been applied correctly before model training. Understanding the data is essential to avoid common mistakes and ensure the model is learning from relevant information.)](https://youtu.be/WMUt7NOJGbo)
