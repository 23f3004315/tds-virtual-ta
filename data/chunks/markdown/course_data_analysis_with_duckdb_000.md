## Data Analysis with DuckDB

[**[Course Image: Data Analysis with DuckDB]** This section of the "Data Analysis with DuckDB" workshop highlights the key advantages of using DuckDB over Pandas for data analysis. DuckDB excels due to its parallel processing capabilities, which Pandas lacks. Furthermore, DuckDB's use of columnar storage makes it more efficient for analytical tasks compared to Pandas' row-based storage. Finally, DuckDB utilizes on-disk operations, allowing it to handle larger datasets that don't fit entirely in memory, unlike Pandas which loads everything into memory. This sets the stage for calculating the number of unique delayed routes.tages of using DuckDB over Pandas for data analysis, especially when dealing with larger datasets. It emphasizes that DuckDB leverages parallel processing, which Pandas can't effectively do, and it uses columnar storage, which is more efficient for analytical queries compared to Pandas' row-based storage. Moreover, DuckDB performs on-disk operations, meaning it doesn't need to load the entire dataset into memory like Pandas does, making it suitable for datasets that exceed available RAM. The content sets the stage for tackling a more complex problem: calculating unique flight routes delayed by various amounts of time, acknowledging the challenge due to the large number of delay categories.)](https://youtu.be/4U0GqYrET5s)

You'll learn how to perform data analysis using DuckDB and Pandas, covering:
