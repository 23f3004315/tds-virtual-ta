in the GA 4 question 5 ( Find the bounding box of a city ) Will the OSM_id ending digits be provided. In the question body they are not there but on submission they come like in the attached screenshot.

**[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image shows a student's attempt to answer a question about the minimum latitude of the bounding box for Tianjin, China, using the Nominatim API. The question is part of the TDS (Think Data Science) project. The student inputted "38.566" as the minimum latitude. The system returned an error message: "Error: Incorrect latitude. Check OSM ID ending with 2077." This indicates the submitted value is incorrect and suggests referencing a specific OSM (OpenStreetMap) ID for the city. This is likely a student question regarding a challenge where the system provides hints or points to specific data sources to resolve it.al data and is facing validation issues with their submitted value. The "Impact" section above the question describes potential benefits of automating bounding box data processing within the UrbanRide context." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="cPGNW0g5bAyZX7v8gl66unj8dCF" width="690" height="159" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image captures a student's attempt to answer the question "What is the minimum latitude of the bounding box of the city Tianjin in the country China on the Nominatim API?" during the "Project 2 - TDS Solver" assignment. The student input the value "38.566" into the answer field, but the system returned an error message: "Error: Incorrect latitude. Check OSM ID ending with 2077". This indicates the student's answer is incorrect, prompting them to re-evaluate their Nominatim API query and focus on the specific OSM ID hinted in the error. The image shows a clear student confusion point regarding data retrieval or interpretation from the Nominatim API related to the bounding box of Tianjin., **[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image captures a student's attempt to answer a question about the minimum latitude of the bounding box for Tianjin, China, using the Nominatim API.

The error implies the student may need to refine their Nominatim query or investigate the OSM data more closely to find the correct minimum latitude. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image depicts a student's attempt to answer a question related to the TDS Solver project, specifically Project 2. The question asks for the minimum latitude of the bounding box of the city Tianjin, China, using the Nominatim API. The student entered "38.566" as the answer, but the system returns an error message: "Error: Incorrect latitude. Check OSM ID ending with 2077". This indicates that the student's answer does not match the expected latitude based on the OpenStreetMap (OSM) data associated with Tianjin's OSM ID. The student needs to investigate further, likely by examining the correct bounding box data from the Nominatim API for Tianjin or by checking the specific OSM ID mentioned in the error message to identify the discrepancy. 2x" data-dominant-color="F4F3F3">image1614Ã—372 45 KB
