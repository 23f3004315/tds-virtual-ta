**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image represents a graded assessment (GA1) discussion thread post from the TDS Jan 2025 cohort, specifically task #16 "Move and rename files" worth 0.5 marks. The task involves downloading and extracting a ZIP file named `q-move-rename-files.zip`. The student must use the `mv` command to move files from subdirectories into a single empty directory and then rename the files, replacing each digit with the next one in sequence, using a provided example (a19b.txt becomes a20b.txt). Finally, the student needs to run the bash command `grep .* | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` on that directory, and the expected output of this command is part of the assessment.ading and extracting the 'q-move-rename-files.zip' archive and using the `mv` command to consolidate files from subfolders into a single empty folder. Further, students must rename the files by incrementing each digit in the filename (e.g., 'a19b.txt' becomes 'a20b.txt'). The task concludes by asking what the output is when the command `grep .* | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` is run in the bash shell within the modified folder." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="ztYoarmvww2WIkqZVCfsxgyDyhj" width="690" height="84" data-dominant-color="292D32">image1296Ã—158 7.29 KB
