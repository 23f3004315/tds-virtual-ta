**[Discussion Image by 22f3000445]** This image depicts a student encountering an "insufficient_quota" error while running a Python script named `request.py` located in their local `TDS` directory, as evidenced by the command `python -u "c:\Users\Varad\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\Temp\TDS\request.py"`. The error message indicates that the student has exceeded their current quota with the OpenAI API and needs to check their plan and billing details. The full error message includes a link to the OpenAI documentation for API errors, suggesting the student is attempting to use the OpenAI API. This is a student question showing the error output in the terminal after running their code. The student can troubleshoot this issue by following the link or logging into their OpenAI account to review billing or API usage limits.e error message received from the OpenAI API indicates "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details," signaling an 'insufficient_quota' issue. The error message also provides a URL to the OpenAI API documentation for further guidance. This likely represents a student question regarding API usage limits, or a peer showing that they hit an API limit." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="98T9MjGc66m8Hwyd7nKfihdZMac" width="690" height="99" data-dominant-color="272929">image1017Ã—146 6.62 KB
