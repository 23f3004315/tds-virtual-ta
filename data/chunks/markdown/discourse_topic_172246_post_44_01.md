 bonus system. The assumption that those who did not attempt GA7 chose not to put in effort is not accurate, respectfully.

You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all.

I would like to point out that many of us, myself included, showed consistent diligence by completing and submitting GA1 through GA6. **Personally, I solved GA5 and GA6 even after solving my Best 4 GAs purely for the learning experience**, knowing they wouldn’t necessarily impact my grade directly. I never avoided GA7 out of carelessness—I simply prioritized the fact that only the best 4 GA scores would count. This is not a lack of effort or interest in the subject matter.

Further, you mentioned:

The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity.

I completely respect the effort put in by those students.

However, I would like to offer another perspective: what if some among those 192 had not completed their best 4 GAs prior to GA7? Meanwhile, those of us who consistently completed all previous GAs(excluding GA7) from the start are now excluded from this opportunity—not due to lack of interest, but due to lack of communication.

If the bonus is truly a recognition of effort *specific to GA7*, then it might be more fair to reflect that in the **GA7 score** only, not in the **overall course total**, which affects students who were consistently involved across the term.
