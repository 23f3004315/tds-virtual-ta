Issue with Marks Not Updated on Dashboard
Dear Team,

I would like to bring to your attention that although I have successfully passed **at least one out of the five questions**, the marks have **not yet been updated** in my dashboard.

Kindly look into this issue and update my Project 2 marks accordingly.

Thank you for your assistance!
