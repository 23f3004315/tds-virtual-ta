**[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** The image captures a student's attempt to run a FastAPI application with Uvicorn and troubleshoot API endpoint access. The Python code (`main.py`) defines a `/api` endpoint that filters students based on class, reading student data from a CSV file. The student has enabled CORS and is using debugging print statements to inspect `class_` and `filtered_students`. In the terminal, Uvicorn is running and serving the application on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The terminal output shows successful GET requests to `/api`, but also a "404 Not Found" error for a specific class request, suggesting a potential issue with request parameters or routing. The student is likely trying to verify that Uvicorn is running and that API requests are processed correctly, but is facing issues with specific routes not being found.ay be debugging URL parameter handling and server configuration." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-14 at 1.39.39 AM" data-base62-sha1="5azawQ2BB3XGDe8UVJ3QGH3G5Vz" width="690" height="431" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** This image captures a student's code and terminal output related to a FastAPI application deployment, which is a peer discussion around the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" assignment. The code in `main.py` defines a FastAPI app that loads student data from a CSV file and provides an API endpoint `/api` to filter students by class. The student is using `uvicorn` to run the application locally on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, as seen in the terminal output, with output showing successful requests to `/api` but also a `404 Not Found` error for the `/class=...` endpoint. The student uses print statements for debugging, and the UI screenshot indicates the student is trying to verify the Uvicorn setup, suggesting a troubleshooting or learning activity., **[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** This image captures a student's attempt to deploy a FastAPI application using Uvicorn, likely as part of a TDS course assignment, showcased in post #9 of a discussion thread. The Python code (`main.py`) defines a FastAPI app that reads student data from a CSV file and provides an endpoint (`/api`) to filter students by class, enabling CORS for broader accessibility. The student has implemented debugging print statements to monitor requested classes and filtered students. The terminal output shows Uvicorn running, successful GET requests to `/api` with class query parameters (e.g., `?class=1A`), and the necessary steps to run the server using `uvicorn main:app --reload`. There is also a 404 error related to some other request. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** This image shows a student's code and terminal output related to a FastAPI application. The student is using Uvicorn to run the app, which loads student data from a CSV file and provides an API endpoint `/api` to filter students by class. The code includes CORS middleware setup, CSV file reading, and a `get_students` function with an optional query parameter for class filtering, along with debugging print statements to track requested and filtered classes. The terminal output shows Uvicorn running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and logs of incoming requests, including OPTIONS requests (returning 200 OK), a 404 Not Found error for the root path "/", and successful GET requests to `/api` with and without query parameters, indicating the basic API endpoint is working. The student seems to be testing the API with class filtering and viewing Uvicorn's output. 2x" data-dominant-color="4C5A66">Screenshot 2025-01-14 at 1.39.39 AM1440Ã—900 154 KB
