Since ROE is done and whatever everyone has scored cannot be changed. Well, we can make up for the marks that we lost by having few more extra activities, if thatâ€™s possible @s.anand sir. That way we get back what we lost, improve CGPA (irrespective of whatever CGPA one has) and learn in the process that would be a win-win situation for everyone.
