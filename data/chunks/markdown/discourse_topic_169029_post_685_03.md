 the exact question, but it seems that the question can be modified with search terms and points. For example, in the account, it was stated as [‘text editor’, at least 77 points’]. If this were the parameter, then my answer would be correct, and I have proof.

**[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** This image shows a search result from Hacker News for "https://github.com/sminez/ad," likely as part of a student's research or looking for relevant code. The search results display two entries, both labeled as "Ad: An Adaptable Text Editor" and linking to the specified GitHub repository. Each entry includes metadata such as points, author, time since posting, and comment count. The search interface also features dropdown menus for filtering by "Stories", "Popularity", and "All time". This context suggests a student may be investigating or referencing a specific GitHub project related to adaptable text editors for the TDS Solver project."Ads" for "An Adaptable Text Editor" whose links match the search. Each ad also shows its score, author, and comments. This likely represents a discussion about possible github repository solutions for the TDS solver project." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="2VXMWk3bfbhedqrg5UNYPrHLCJz" width="690" height="309" data-dominant-color="E9DDCA">image855×383 19.5 KB
