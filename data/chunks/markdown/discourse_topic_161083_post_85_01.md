**[Discussion Image by 23f3002537]** This image shows a student attempting an assignment related to development tools, specifically task 16, involving moving and renaming files in a Linux environment. The student downloads "q-move-rename-files.zip", extracts the contents, and then moves all the files under folders into an empty folder. Next, the assignment instructs the student to rename the files, replacing each digit with the next higher digit (e.g., 1 becomes 2, 9 becomes 0). The student then tries to determine what the command `grep .* | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` outputs when run in bash on that folder and provides a hash "f1056c0b734ac835d17e8129fe9dc9a85ebcca45a82de42b13d18b7816808b7d *" as the answer. The response is flagged as "Incorrect. Try again." indicating the student's attempt was unsuccessful and there is a problem in their answer. as incorrect, with the feedback "Incorrect. Try again"." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="f4JgMATlggCuYlrNd9XZ9fsXJI" width="690" height="149" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f3002537]** This image shows a student attempting a coding challenge, specifically task 16 which involves moving and renaming files. The instructions require downloading and extracting "q-move-rename-files.zip", moving all files to an empty folder, and renaming them by incrementing each digit (1 becomes 2, 9 becomes 0). The challenge then asks what the output of the bash command `grep .* | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` would be. The student provided an incorrect answer, "f1056c0b734ac835d17e8129fe9dc9a85ebcca45a82de42b13d18b7816808b7d*", and received the feedback "Incorrect. Try again." This indicates the student is likely struggling with the file manipulation and shell scripting aspects of the task, possibly misinterpreting the renaming rule or making errors in the bash pipeline. The expected output is likely the SHA256 checksum of the sorted file contents after renaming, obtained using `grep`, `sort` and `sha256sum`., **[Discussion Image by 23f3002537]** This image depicts a student attempting a programming assignment in the TDS "Development Tools" course, specifically task 16: "Move and rename files". The student downloads "q-move-rename-files.zip," extracts it, moves files to an empty folder, and renames them according to the rule where each digit is replaced by the next (1 becomes 2, 9 becomes 0, a1b9c.txt becomes a2b0c.txt). The student then runs the bash command `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` on the folder and enters a SHA256 hash as the answer, but the system flags it as "Incorrect. Try again," indicated by the error icon. This suggests the student may have made a mistake in either the file renaming process, the bash command execution, or perhaps has misread the expected output format. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f3002537]** This image depicts a student's attempt to answer a programming question in a TDS discussion forum, specifically "GA1 - Development Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]". The question, worth 0.5 marks, involves downloading a zip file named "q-move-rename-files.zip", extracting its contents, using `mv` to move files under folders into an empty folder, and renaming files such that digits are replaced with the next digit (1 becomes 2, 9 becomes 0, e.g. a1b9c.txt becomes a2b0c.txt). The student is then asked what the output of the bash command `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` would be when run in that folder. The student entered the SHA256 checksum "f1056c0b734ac835d17e8129fe9dc9a85ebcca45a82de42b13d18b7816808b7d *", but the system indicates "Incorrect. Try again." suggesting the response did not match the expected output, indicating a need for debugging. 2x" data-dominant-color="282C30">image1641Ã—356 26.7 KB
