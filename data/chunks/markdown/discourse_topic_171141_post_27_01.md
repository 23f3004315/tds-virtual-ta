 does not include any **`POST` or `GET` request traces**, unlike the other tasks which have clearly recorded request flows, generated code, and outputs. In these three cases, the log shows only the failure message without any indication that the script was executed or that the output file was read.

**[Discussion Image by 23f1001611]** This image is a log output from a student's attempt to solve a programming task within TDS, revealing a mixture of successful and failed test cases. Initially, task B6, which involves scraping author names from a webpage and saving them to a JSON file, passed successfully as indicated by "B6 PASSED." However, the following tasks, B7 and B8, failed; task B7 simply states "B7 failed," while B8 has the error message "failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting," suggesting an issue with string formatting in the code. The output also shows the HTTP requests and server responses, including a code snippet attempting to scrape data from `quotes.toscrape.com` and save it to `/data/b6.json`, offering insight into the attempted solution and where the error might be located in relation to string formatting for subsequent tasks. Finally, the task running downloads and resizes an image, indicating a possible connection between image processing and the reported errors.erted during string formatting" suggests an issue with how variables are being inserted into a string, requiring review and correction of the associated Python code." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="rAPE8z6usRTHkquLBzH81ERRoZU" width="690" height="256" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1001611]** This image shows the output of a task execution in a TDS project, indicating a mix of successful and failed steps, representing a student debugging session. It begins with an HTTP POST request to `/run` and retrieves quote authors, saving them to `/data/b6.json`, which is marked as B6 PASSED, including the Python code used for this task. Following this, the system attempts to download, resize, and save an image in task B7, and subsequent task B8, both of which fail, with B8 indicating "not all arguments converted during string formatting". The error message on B8 suggests a problem with string formatting in the student's code, specifically an incomplete or incorrect substitution of variables within a string. The output shows successful retrieval of data in task B6, but issues with image manipulation and string formatting in later tasks, highlighting areas where the student needs to troubleshoot their code., **[Discussion Image by 23f1001611]** This image captures a portion of a TDS student discussion, specifically focused on troubleshooting errors in a project. It shows the results of running code against a server, with task B6 passing successfully (related to extracting author names from a webpage and saving them to a JSON file), but tasks B7 and B8 failing. Task B7 involves downloading an image from a URL, resizing it, and saving it. Task B8, which failed because "not all arguments converted during string formatting", relates to some formatting issue. The provided code snippet demonstrates how the author names were extracted from 'quotes.toscrape.com' using requests and BeautifulSoup, saved to `/data/b6.json`, and includes error handling with exception printing. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1001611]** This image captures a student's troubleshooting process for a project, specifically highlighting discrepancies during task execution. The initial HTTP request shows a POST request to `/run` to scrape author names from a website and save them to `/data/b6.json`, which was successful (B6 PASSED). However, a subsequent task (Running task) involving downloading an image, resizing it, and saving it as `/data/b7.png` failed (B7 FAILED). Additionally, task B8 failed with the error message "not all arguments converted during string formatting," suggesting an issue with string formatting within the code for that task. The failure of both B7 and B8 indicates problems with image processing or string manipulation aspects of the student's project. 2x" data-dominant-color="F8F8F8">image2003Ã—745 95 KB
