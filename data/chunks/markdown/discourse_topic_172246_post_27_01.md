Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7?

I have read the email regarding GA7 and the associated bonus marks. The email states that:

DEADLINE: 10th April, 2025 23:59:59pm

GA7 requires you to submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for your submission.

Please find the form link below to submit your evaluations.

https://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9

AFTER completing your initial 3 peer reviews which were sent in the previous email,

if you submit 5 additional reviews, you will be awarded upto 5 BONUS MARKS to your final T score. For example if your final TDS score is 75, doing all 5 extra peer reviews can boost your final score in TDS to 80.

You will have to submit the form 5 times (1 for each peer). Use the same form link to submit 5 different reviews. Your Bonus score will still be based on the metrics derived for the initial 3 peer reviews, but scaled for 5 peer reviews.

You have been given the peer submissions as links to HTML files which you have to download and view in a browser.

Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus?

From the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks.

Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus?
