**[Discussion Image by 22f2000008]** This image captures a student's code and the resulting error within a TDS student discussion. The Python code aims to fetch weather data, convert it to JSON format, and print it. The code uses `pd.date_range` to generate a date list and then iterates to map dates to descriptions obtained through an API call. An `IndexError: list index out of range` arises on line 24 during the construction of `weather_url`: `'https://www.bbc.com/weather/' + result['response']['results']['results'][0]['id']`. This suggests that the JSON response received from the API lacks the expected structure (particularly the `'results'` list might be empty), causing an attempt to access index `[0]` on an empty list, hence the error.nshot captures the traceback for debugging purposes." alt="WhatsApp Image 2025-02-09 at 12.42.40_7957510c" data-base62-sha1="cJdWCxbThbkDAPAgeegZN8bqoDk" width="690" height="388" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f2000008]** This image captures a student's coding problem within the TDS Jan 2025 "GA4 - Data Sourcing" discussion thread. The student is encountering an `IndexError: list index out of range` in their Python code while trying to fetch weather data, specifically when constructing the `weather_url`. The error occurs at line 24 of the traceback: `weather_url = 'https://www.bbc.com/weather/' + result['response']['results']['results'][0]['id']`, suggesting the `result` dictionary (obtained via `requests.get(location_url).json()`) does not contain the expected nested 'response', 'results', and 'results' structure with a non-empty list at index 0. The code aims to map dates to weather descriptions, convert it to JSON, and print the JSON output, but the IndexError stops the program before it reaches that goal. The student will likely need to inspect the structure of the `result` object (JSON response) to understand why the expected keys and list index are missing or empty., **[Discussion Image by 22f2000008]** This image shows a student's code and the resulting error traceback, indicating a likely student question in the discussion thread. The code attempts to fetch weather data, first creating a date list using `pd.date_range` and `strftime`, then mapping dates to descriptions, converting the data to JSON, and finally printing the JSON. An `IndexError: list index out of range` occurs on line 24, specifically within the `weather_url` assignment, pointing to an issue with the data structure returned by `result['response']['results']['results'][0]['id']`. This implies that the 'results' list might be empty, thus causing an out-of-bounds access attempt at index 0. The student likely needs to handle cases where the list is empty to avoid the error. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f2000008]** This image captures a student's code and the error message encountered while working on a Python script to fetch weather data, likely part of the TDS GA4 course. The code attempts to create a `weather_url` by concatenating a base URL with data extracted from a JSON response obtained using the `requests` library. The error is an `IndexError: list index out of range`, which occurs on line 24 where the script tries to access `result['response']['results']['results'][0]['id']`. This indicates that the `'results'` list within the JSON response is either empty or structured differently than expected, causing the attempt to access the element at index `[0]` to fail. The traceback points to the line causing the error, which helps with debugging. 2x" data-dominant-color="9D9E9D">WhatsApp Image 2025-02-09 at 12.42.40_7957510c1280Ã—720 109 KB
