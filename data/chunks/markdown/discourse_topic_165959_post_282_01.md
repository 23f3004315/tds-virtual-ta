**[Discussion Image by 22ds2000011]** This image captures a student's question about what constitutes valid JSON data, showcasing an attempt to input movie data as a JSON object array. The student provides JSON including "title," "year," and "rating" fields for a movie, but receives an error message: "At [8].title: Values don't match. Expected: "9. Incorrect answer jalement invités". Actual: "9. You're Cordially Invited"." This indicates a data validation mismatch, where the expected value for the "title" field in the 8th entry differs from the actual value, suggesting an issue in the input data or the validation process. The error's detail highlights a discrepancy between an expected title containing the phrase "Incorrect answer" and an actual title, likely for a different movie or show, "You're Cordially Invited." This seems to be a validation error while trying to enter movie details, and the expected and actual titles do not match up.expected structure or dataset, and the task is failing due to differing values for the "title" field in a particular record." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="xfVpigmDLN8HUtD3uS2IYIvLGJ" width="690" height="131" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22ds2000011]** This image depicts a student question about "What is the JSON data?" and an accompanying error message suggesting a problem with data validation. The provided JSON snippet includes keys like "title", "year", and "rating" with corresponding string values. The error message "At [8].title: Values don't match. Expected: '9. Incorrect answer jalement invités'. Actual: '9. You're Cordially Invited'" indicates a discrepancy between the expected and actual values for the "title" field within the 8th element of an array (likely within the larger JSON structure). This suggests the student is attempting to validate or parse JSON data against a predefined schema or expected dataset, and the "title" field in the provided data does not match the expected value at that specific index. It highlights a need to examine the provided JSON data against the validation rules to ensure accurate and consistent data input., **[Discussion Image by 22ds2000011]** This image shows a student question regarding JSON data, likely related to a TDS Jan 2025 course, where the student is encountering an error. The student asks, "What is the JSON data?" and provides an example of JSON data containing "title", "year", and "rating". An error message is shown at the bottom: "Error: At [8].title: Values don't match. Expected: '9. Incorrect answer jalement invités'. Actual: '9. You're Cordially Invited'". This indicates a data validation issue where the expected value for the 'title' field in the 8th record does not match the actual value found in the data. The student is likely struggling with the correct format or content required for the "title" field in a specific record within the JSON data, causing the validation error. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22ds2000011]** This image captures a student question within a TDS Jan 2025 GA4 discussion thread, specifically related to data sourcing and JSON data. The student has included a code snippet of what appears to be partial JSON data with `"title": "1. The Night Agent"`, `"year": "2023-"`, and `"rating": "7.5"`. An error message is displayed indicating a mismatch in values at index 8 for the "title" field. It shows that the expected value was "9. Incorrect answer jalement invités", but the actual value received was "9. You're Cordially Invited". This suggests a data validation error where the actual data doesn't align with the expected format or content defined in the validation criteria. 2x" data-dominant-color="28292D">image2100×400 38.1 KB
