atorily being a system message. With that in mind, i also tried the alternative

`user_message = "2 b7 rkS94mn4 \n AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS"`

The error message i keep receiving is as below.

**[Discussion Image by 24f2006531]** This image captures a potential student question in the TDS GA3 Large Language Models discussion thread, specifically showcasing an error encountered while working with payloads, indicating peer discussion. The code snippet shows the beginning of a `payload = {` assignment. An error message is displayed: "Error: The user message must be 2 b7 rkS94mn4 AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS, not 2 b7 rkS94mn4 AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS". The error suggests a mismatch between the expected and actual user message content or length when defining the payload, potentially due to a formatting issue. This likely represents a point of confusion for the student as they are trying to define or modify the payload structure for the LLM. Resolution of this error would involve checking the assignment's syntax and values against the specified requirements for user messages.ely for an LLM-related API call. The error message states "The user message must be 2 b7 rkS94mn4 AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS, not 2 b7 rkS94mn4 AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS". This suggests the LLM service is expecting a specific message format or length, but it is receiving the same string it expects not to receive, indicating a potential duplication or incorrect initialization in the payload. The student will likely need guidance on properly formatting the user message field within the payload to conform to the LLM's requirements, potentially trimming it or ensuring uniqueness if needed." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="gytebKLwoJRYvxAXz46owLm92Th" width="690" height="52" data-dominant-color="312C30">
