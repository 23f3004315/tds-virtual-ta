**[Discussion Image by 23f1001231]** This image captures a peer discussion where a student is sharing their ngrok URL as part of the "Project 2 - TDS Solver" assignment in the TDS course. The instructions prompt the student to download Llamafile, run a specified Llama model, and create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok. The student provides their ngrok URL as: "https://aafb-2405-201-4007-c068-eb1d-b640-5d42-2493.ngrok-free.app", demonstrating they have successfully created the ngrok tunnel. This helps peers verify or troubleshoot their own setups by comparing URL structures, which follow the format: https://[random].ngrok-free.app/.truct.Q6_K.llamafile model, then create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok. The student then provides their generated ngrok URL, specifically "https://aafb-2405-201-4007-c068-eb1d-b640-5d42-2493.ngrok-free.app", and requests confirmation if this is the expected format, referring to an example format of "https://[random].ngrok-free.app/". This shows the student seeking validation that their setup with Llamafile and ngrok is progressing correctly." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="uMZ5WDcbdJBvVTReEuQYRbQFkFP" width="690" height="195" data-dominant-color="2D3237">image780Ã—221 21.5 KB
