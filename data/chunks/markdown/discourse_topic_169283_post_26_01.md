**[Discussion Image by Rishabh2]** This image shows a student's Python code and the resulting output for calculating and sorting distances between communities and a central command post using the haversine formula. The code first defines the coordinates for each location and then calculates the distances using the imported `haversine` function, storing them in a dictionary called `distances`. The `sorted` function is used with `distances.get` as the key to sort the communities based on these distances. Finally, the code iterates through the sorted communities and prints the evacuation sequence along with the corresponding distance formatted to two decimal places, as evidenced by the f-string: `print(f"{i}. {community} - Distance: {distances[community]:.2f} km")`. The output displays the communities in ascending order of distance from the central command post, effectively providing an optimal evacuation sequence.ion, and then sorts these locations based on their distance from the central command post. The student uses a dictionary `distances` to store the calculated distances and then sorts it using `sorted` and a lambda function to specify sorting by value. Finally, the code iterates through the sorted sequence and prints the optimal evacuation sequence, displaying both the community name and the calculated distance with two decimal places. The output displayed at the bottom shows the sorted list of locations with their distances." alt="Screenshot 2025-03-15 205444" data-base62-sha1="mAux9PF93ZPiL5yWJIHJbWOBS6B" width="657" height="500" data-dominant-color="EBECEB">Screenshot 2025-03-15 205444878Ã—668 38.1 KB
