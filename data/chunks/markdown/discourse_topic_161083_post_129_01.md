The screenshot shows the student's dashboard view of Module 1, highlighting the "Graded Assignment 1" with a due date of January 26, 2025, which is marked as "Not Submitted." The student's score is shown as blank ("-"), while the peer average is 99% and the median score is 100. A "Recent saves" section at the bottom displays reload options for attempts saved on January 23, 2025, between 9:32 and 9:33 PM, each showing a score of 8. This suggests the student may be confused about why their attempts haven't been properly submitted or reflected in their overall score, despite having "Recent saves" recorded. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f3001740]** This image shows a student's view of the "Module 1: Development Tools" assignment page, specifically "Graded Assignment 1" due on January 26, 2025.
