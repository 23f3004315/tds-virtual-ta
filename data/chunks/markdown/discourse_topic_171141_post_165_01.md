Hi @Jayeshbansal ,

The docker repo name that you submitted through submission form was different than what your screenshot shows. `/jayeshbansal/add9a05689d3` docker repo doesn’t exists or might not be public, that’s why it failed for you.

**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image displays data from a student submission for a project, likely Project 1 in the TDS course. The data is organized in a table format, with columns for Timestamp, Email Address, GitHub repository link, and DockerHub image name. A search bar at the top is used to filter the data, with the student's email address "24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" entered as the search term. The submission data includes the student's GitHub repository link as "https://github.com/jayesh-bansal/TDS-Project1/" and the DockerHub image name as "jayeshbansal/add9a05689d3". This demonstrates the student providing the required links for project submission, with the instructor likely using this interface to verify the code and image.ssess the student projects based on their code and DockerHub deployment. This context is used for tracking student submissions and identifying the associated resources like GitHub repositories and DockerHub images." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="fL78lx1cRlHCV2KzCLiLJv0GA89" width="690" height="83" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image displays a table-like data structure extracted from a system or tool used for tracking student submissions for Project 1. The first row serves as a header, defining the columns: "Timestamp", "Email Address", "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1?", and "What is the name of the image published on DockerHub?". Row 1022 contains specific submission data for the email address "24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in", including the timestamp "2/16/2025 23:55:44", the GitHub repository link "https://github.com/jayesh-bansal/TDS-Project1/", and the DockerHub image name "jayeshbansal/add9a05689d3". The table can be searched, as evidenced by the search bar pre-filled with "24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in", suggesting a tool used by course staff to quickly look up submissions by student email. This suggests the context is a discrepancy check on student assignments, where instructors are reviewing provided github and dockerhub links., **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image shows a table that is likely part of an automated grading or feedback system within the TDS (The Data Science) course platform, displaying data related to student submissions for Project 1. The table's columns include "Timestamp," "Email Address," "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1?", and "What is the name of the image published on DockerHub?". A specific student, identified by the email address "24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in," submitted their work on February 16, 2025, at 23:55:44, providing a GitHub repository link "https://github.com/jayesh-bansal/TDS-Project1/" and a DockerHub image name "jayeshbansal/add9a05689d3." The search bar at the top contains the same student email, suggesting the table can be filtered or searched. This is not a direct student-instructor interaction, but rather automatically displayed data, possibly to facilitate project discrepancies checks within the course. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image depicts a snippet from a student discussion forum for the TDS (Tractable Data Science) course, specifically related to "Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies." It displays a table-like structure, seemingly derived from a spreadsheet or database view. The first row shows column headers including "Timestamp," "Email Address," "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1?", and "What is the name of the image published on DockerHub?". The second row, corresponding to entry #1022 at timestamp "2/16/2025 23:55:44", shows the email "24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in", the GitHub repository link "https://github.com/jayesh-bansal/TDS-Project1/", and the DockerHub image name "jayeshbansal/add9a05689d3". A search bar is present with the same email address, suggesting a filtering or query operation on the data. This indicates a data reporting or verification step related to students' submissions for Project 1, where the system or instructor is tracking GitHub repositories and DockerHub images associated with student accounts. 2x" data-dominant-color="1A1F26">image1826×222 23 KB
