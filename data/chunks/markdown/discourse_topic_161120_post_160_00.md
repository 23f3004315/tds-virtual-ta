Hi @24f1002359

For **Question 10**, ensure that **all servers are running** every time you submit (click the **Save** button). Since **ngrok generates a new URL each time it runs**, double-check that the **ngrok URL is correct** before submitting.

For **Question 9**, did you **enable CORS**? To verify, check your **browser console**â€”if CORS is not enabled, you should see an error message indicating the issue.
