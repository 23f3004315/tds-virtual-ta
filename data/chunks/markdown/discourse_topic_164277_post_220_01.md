**[Discussion Image by vikramjncasr]** This image shows a student's terminal output, indicating a successful Uvicorn server startup within the TDS Project. The student is running the command `uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000` in the `C:\IIT_Madras\TDS_Project` directory. The server has started successfully, as evidenced by the "Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000" message and the "GET / HTTP/1.1" request returning a 200 OK status. The image demonstrates the correct command to start the Uvicorn server and confirms that the application is accessible at the specified address and port. This output serves as a confirmation that the student's setup is correct at this point.DS_Project` directory, which starts the Uvicorn server on the specified host and port. The console output confirms that the server started, waited for application startup, and then completed startup. The line "Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)" indicates the server is running successfully. A subsequent "GET / HTTP/1.1" request with a 200 OK status code shows that the server is responding to HTTP requests." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="cFlmqgkVc1erxEuGI9rlgBaGA9M" width="690" height="147" data-dominant-color="292726">image985Ã—211 24.1 KB
