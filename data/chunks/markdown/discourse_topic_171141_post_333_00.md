Dockerfile has to be inside root of any github repo, this is standard and we had discussion with Professor Anand about such cases where it’s not part of root directory, he suggested we will consider only Dockerfile being present in root folder of the repo.

Sorry but its not possible to attend every single session and you guys haven’t informed us via email so how its our fault.For cases like this you guys should allow us to move our files to the root directory so it can work…(we just have to move files in the repo please consider it)@carlton @Saransh_Saini @s.anand

(i have already made a rookie mistake in my dockerfile otherwise i would have got 9/25 but keeping that aside please let me get 6/25)
