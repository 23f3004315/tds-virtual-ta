**[Discussion Image by 23f2002592]** This image shows a student attempting a graded task in the TDS GA1 "Development Tools" assignment. The task involves downloading and unzipping a file named `q-replace-across-files.zip`, then replacing all instances of "IITM" (case-insensitive) with "IIT Madras" in all files within the unzipped folder. The next step requires the student to run the bash command `cat * | sha256sum` inside the modified folder, and then submit the resulting SHA256 hash. The image displays that the student submitted the hash `63144b28ad1d2bd5b9b4b0855cab6a4a4fa8d57ed2ed826b4f5b36d12ae97347`, which was marked as "Incorrect. Try again." indicating a potential error in either the replacement process or the hashing calculation.from either incorrect file replacement, file encoding differences that affect the SHA256 checksum, or an error in the command itself." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-25 171014" data-base62-sha1="3bYjIYyKwczQax9b66ESQ28uTEp" width="690" height="130" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2002592]** This image shows a student attempting an assignment related to development tools in the TDS Jan 2025 course. The student is instructed to download a zip file named "q-replace-across-files.zip", unzip it, replace all occurrences of "IITM" (case-insensitive) with "IIT Madras" in all files within the unzipped folder, and then run the command `cat * | sha256sum` in bash within the folder. The student's provided SHA256 sum, "63144b28ad1d2bd5b9b4b0855cab6a4a4fa8d57ed2ed826b4f5b36d12ae97347", is marked as incorrect, indicating an error in either the file replacement process or the subsequent SHA256 sum calculation. The student needs to re-evaluate their steps and ensure they correctly followed the instructions., **[Discussion Image by 23f2002592]** This image captures a student's attempt to answer a question in the "GA1 - Development Tools" discussion thread. The student downloaded and unzipped the `q-replace-across-files.zip` file and was instructed to replace all instances of "IITM" with "IIT Madras" without altering line endings. Then the student has to run `cat * | sha256sum` inside the folder to get an answer. The student entered "63144b28ad1d2bd5b9b4b0855cab6a4a4fa8d57ed2ed826b4f5b36d12ae97347" as the result of the command but received an "Incorrect. Try again." error message, indicating the SHA256 sum calculation was not correct. This demonstrates the student struggling to execute the bash command correctly after the file manipulation steps. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2002592]** This image shows a student's attempt to answer a question in a TDS development tools discussion thread. The question asks what output the bash command `cat * | sha256sum` produces in a specific folder, after performing the described "IITM" replacement task from the `q-replace-across-files.zip` archive. The student provides a SHA256 hash value `63144b28ad1d2bd5b9b4b0855cab6a4a4fa8d57ed2ed826b4f5b36d12ae97347` as their answer, but the system marks it as "Incorrect. Try again.", indicating the provided hash is wrong for the transformed files. The provided command `cat * | sha256sum` concatenates all files in the directory and then calculates the SHA256 hash of the combined content, therefore the student needs to download, unzip, perform the replacement and then run the described command to find the correct hash. 2x" data-dominant-color="272B31">Screenshot 2025-01-25 1710141631Ã—309 22.2 KB
