**[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** This image captures a troubleshooting scenario where a student encounters an `ERR_NGROK_8012` error while using ngrok to tunnel traffic. The error message indicates that while the traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, the agent was unable to establish a connection to the upstream web service running at `http://localhost:5000`. The specific error is "dial tcp [::1]:5000: connect: connection refused", suggesting a connection issue. Ngrok's troubleshooting message prompts the student (as the developer) to ensure that a web service is indeed running on `http://localhost:5000` on the machine where the ngrok agent is active, recommending a cURL test or opening the address in a browser to verify the response. The student is directed to documentation for further assistance and advised to refresh the page or contact the developer if the problem persists. on the machine running the Ngrok agent. The status indicator at the top also shows that "Your Service" is failing to connect." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-14 at 8.54.07 PM" data-base62-sha1="bxPCwKmsNcZuGNCCQMt6RbtYP6A" width="690" height="431" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** This image shows a troubleshooting screen related to an ngrok tunnel setup, representing a student question within the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" discussion. The error "ERR_NGROK_8012" indicates that while the tunnel was successfully created, ngrok couldn't connect to the application running on `http://localhost:5000`. The error message "dial tcp [::1]:5000: connect: connection refused" suggests that either no application is running on port 5000, or there's a firewall blocking the connection. The suggestions given by ngrok are to ensure that a web service is running on `http://localhost:5000` on the machine where the ngrok agent is running and to verify this by using `cURL` or opening the address in a browser. Refreshing the page is recommended for visitors, and consulting the documentation or contacting the developer is advised for further troubleshooting., **[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** This image depicts an error screen from ngrok, likely encountered by a student during the deployment tools assignment (GA2). The error, "ERR_NGROK_8012", indicates that while the traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, the agent failed to establish a connection to the upstream web service at `http://localhost:5000`. The specific error message is "dial tcp [::1]:5000: connect: connection refused," implying that the ngrok agent couldn't connect to the local web server. The message suggests ensuring a web service is running on `http://localhost:5000` on the machine where the ngrok agent is running, either by trying to cURL or opening the address in a browser. This is likely a student question because the instructions given by the error message are the most common way to fix this type of issue, meaning it's likely the student has not done this yet. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23F300327]** This image depicts an error screen from ngrok, signaling a connection issue during deployment. Specifically, it shows an `ERR_NGROK_8012` error, indicating that while the traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, the agent failed to establish a connection to the upstream web service at `http://localhost:5000`. The detailed error message is "dial tcp [::1]:5000: connect: connection refused," implying that the service wasn't running or accessible on that port. The page suggests troubleshooting steps, advising the developer to ensure a web service is running on `http://localhost:5000` and to try accessing it via cURL or a browser. This is a case of peer debugging where student may have faced the issue and posted the screenshot of error message to the discussion thread. 2x" data-dominant-color="DFDCDE">Screenshot 2025-01-14 at 8.54.07 PM1440Ã—900 80.5 KB
