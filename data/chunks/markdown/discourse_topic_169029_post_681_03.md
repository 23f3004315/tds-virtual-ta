**[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image captures a student encountering an error while using Postman to interact with the fileqa-app.vercel.app API for Project 2 (TDS Solver). The student is sending a POST request to the `/api/` endpoint, with the `form-data` body containing a "question" field set to "What is the value in the "answer" column of the..." and intends to send a "file" field with "abcd.zip". However, the "file" checkbox is not checked, indicating the file is not being included in the request. Consequently, the API returns a "400 Bad Request" error, with the JSON response showing `"error": "Missing question or file"`. The student's confusion stems from receiving the same error message as the evaluation report, even though a file is indicated in Postman, but it is not being sent due to the unchecked checkbox. This highlights a common troubleshooting step: verifying that all intended form data fields are correctly enabled (checked).ror message `"error": "Missing question or file"`. This indicates the server expects both question text and a file, but it only received the question. The student seems confused since the error is the same as the evaluation report error. Selecting the checkbox next to `file` would likely resolve the issue, ensuring the file is included in the request payload." alt="Screenshot at Apr 17 18-35-46" data-base62-sha1="2zXFUIDr1ODLotdtpVCSqfvd2MQ" width="690" height="332" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image shows a student's attempt to use a POST request to the specified API endpoint using Postman, but the request fails. The student has provided a "question" parameter with a text value and has selected a file named "abcd.zip", but the checkbox next to the "file" key is unchecked, indicating that the file is not being included in the request. As a result, the API returns a "400 Bad Request" error with the message "Missing question or file" in the JSON response body, indicating the student is sending the request without the file. This example captures a student's troubleshooting process when encountering errors related to file uploads via APIs. The student needs to check the file box to actually send the file., **[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image captures a student's debugging attempt within the TDS project 2 discussion. The student is using Postman to send a POST request to the `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` endpoint, aiming to provide a question and a file. The request's "Body" section is configured as "form-data", including a "question" field with a text value and a "file" field pointing to "abcd.zip". However, the "file" field's checkbox is unchecked. Consequently, the student receives a "400 Bad Request" error with the message "Missing question or file", mirroring the evaluation report, indicating the file was not properly included in the request. The confusion arises because the student has a file selected, but hasn't enabled the sending of the file parameter. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image shows a student's question regarding sending a POST request to `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` using a REST client, in the context of a TDS Solver project. The student is attempting to send both a "question" text and a "file" (abcd.zip) as `form-data` in the body of the request, but the "file" checkbox is not selected, implying the file is not correctly included in the request. The response body displays a "400 Bad Request" error, with the message `"error": "Missing question or file"`, indicating that either the question or the file parameter is not being received by the server. The student's confusion stems from the server reporting a missing file, even though the file is visible in the request parameters within the REST client UI, and the student indicates the response is similar to the evaluation report. 2x" data-dominant-color="F9F7F8">Screenshot at Apr 17 18-35-461948×940 136 KB
