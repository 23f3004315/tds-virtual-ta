**[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image shows a student's troubleshooting step while working on the TDS project, specifically dealing with Docker logs. The student is navigating through their file system in Windows Explorer, specifically in "This PC > Downloads > docker_logs.zip". Inside the zip archive, the file explorer shows "No items match your search," after the student searched for the string "23f2001390" within the "docker_logs.zip" archive. It's likely the student is attempting to locate specific log entries or a particular log file within the zipped archive using a search term, but the search yields no results. This suggests a potential issue with the logging configuration, the presence of the searched string in the logs, or even whether the logs were generated correctly in the first place.he student is struggling to extract or view the contents of the docker log file, leading them to seek assistance or verification from peers about this empty file issue, potentially a sign of incomplete or incorrect logging." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="9jP46fB7vquZ92zeRUCvDlWsRVV" width="690" height="327" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image is likely posted by a student during a peer discussion about their project 1 discrepancies within the TDS course. The screenshot depicts a Windows file explorer window, navigated to "This PC > Downloads > docker_logs.zip". The search bar contains the string "23f2001390", but the file listing area shows "No items match your search," indicating the student is trying to locate a file, possibly using a specific ID or name, inside the `docker_logs.zip` archive, but the search is unsuccessful. This indicates a potential problem with either the contents of the zip file or the correctness of the search term. The student is probably confused about why the expected file is not found within the `docker_logs.zip` file., **[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image captures a student's troubleshooting process while working on TDS Project 1, specifically related to discrepancies in 'docker_logs.zip'. The screenshot shows the contents of the downloaded 'docker_logs.zip' file in Windows Explorer after navigating to 'This PC > Downloads > docker_logs.zip'. The file appears empty, as indicated by the "No items match your search" message despite the student searching for a file named '23f2001390' using the Windows search bar in the upper right. This suggests the student is either searching within the zip file incorrectly or the zip file is genuinely empty, leading to confusion regarding expected log file contents. The student may be expecting to find log files associated with a specific identifier (23f2001390) within the downloaded archive. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Haricharan]** This image depicts a student's attempt to access the contents of a "docker_logs.zip" file, likely as part of troubleshooting a project. The file explorer shows that the student has navigated to the "Downloads" folder and opened the zipped file. However, the content pane displays the message "No items match your search", indicating the archive appears to be empty, or that a search for "23f2001390" within the archive yielded no results. This suggests a potential problem with the archive itself (e.g., it may be corrupted, incomplete, or not contain the expected files) or an incorrect search parameter. This could lead the student to ask for assistance in determining why the logs are not accessible, or where to find the correct log information for the project. 2x" data-dominant-color="FDFDFE">image1078Ã—511 8.14 KB
