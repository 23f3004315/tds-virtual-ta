**[Discussion Image by Anshuman_Dave]** This image is a screenshot from a student's attempt at a graded assignment, reflecting a student question. The student, Anshuman_Dave, has multiple "Reload" attempts with scores (9, 8.5, and 8) but is concerned their submission won't be evaluated because they forgot to click "Yes" to the statement "I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it." The UI shows the question with "Yes" and "No" radio buttons, the selected answer is "No", which is marked incorrect and shows a score of 0, even though multiple saved attempts exist with higher scores. A message warns that the student MUST use their Student ID (e.g. 22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) to do the Graded Assignment for their score to be considered. The student is asking for an exception to be made so their saved score can be evaluated despite the "No" answer.have attempted it.", with "Yes" and "No" options, and the student has selected "No", resulting in the feedback "No, the answer is incorrect. Score: 0" even though they scored higher when submitting the assignment. The "Accepted answer" is "Yes", indicating the student should have selected "Yes" on that initial question. The student also shows "Reload" buttons for three submissions with different scores and timestamps." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="n3INsPMuX4ocV8MF14C19a948to" width="617" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Anshuman_Dave]** This image depicts a student question regarding a graded assignment submission.
