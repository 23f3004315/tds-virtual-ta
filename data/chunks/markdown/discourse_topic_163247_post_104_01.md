**[Discussion Image by 22f2000644]** This image captures a student's attempt to configure their API endpoint for the "GA3 - Large Language Models" assignment, specifically in relation to CORS settings. The system prompts the student to provide the API URL endpoint and suggests a possible format like "http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute". The student enters "http://127.0.0.1:8001/execute" into the input field, but the system flags it with an error, indicating a "TypeError: Load failed", along with a red error icon. The interface explains that the system will verify the endpoint by sending a GET request with a query parameter and that arguments must be in the same order as the function definition, implying this is related to an automated validation. The student likely needs to correct the URL and potentially enable CORS for the origin to resolve the error before clicking the "Check" button.ing system from reaching it.

The platform prompts the student to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow GET requests from any origin, suggesting that the API might be rejecting requests from the student's current location due to CORS restrictions. The platform also mentions it will verify the API by sending a GET request with a 'q' parameter containing a task and ensuring the response matches the expected output, emphasizing the importance of argument order matching the function definition. The student has entered "http://127.0.0.1:8001/execute" into the API URL field and clicked the "Check" button, leading to the error and likely prompting this discussion post. The suggested correct URL is "http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute"., **[Discussion Image by 22f2000644]** This image captures a student's attempt to configure the API URL endpoint in the TDS GA3 Large Language Models assignment, as part of a discussion thread. The UI prompts the student to enter the API endpoint, providing an example like `http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute`. The student has entered `http://127.0.0.1:8001/execute`, but the UI displays an error message: "TypeError: Load failed" and highlights the input box in red, signaling a problem. The platform emphasizes the need to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for allowing GET requests from any origin, and indicates that the system will test the URL with a GET request containing a task, ensuring correct argument order. The "Check" button at the bottom implies a validation step that the student is attempting to use. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f2000644]** This image depicts a student facing an error when attempting to validate an API endpoint during a TDS Large Language Models assignment in January 2025. The student is prompted to enter their API URL, which they've entered as "http://127.0.0.1:8001/execute". The UI shows an error message "TypeError: Load failed" alongside a red warning icon, indicating the endpoint is not loading correctly. The system informs the student that it will check the endpoint with a GET request and verify the response. A critical instruction reminds the student to ensure CORS is enabled to allow GET requests from any origin, and the submit button is labeled "Check". 2x" data-dominant-color="26282C">Screenshot 2025-02-05 at 6.19.41 PM1304Ã—299 30.1 KB
