## Forecasting with Excel

[**[Course Image: Forecasting with Excel]** This image illustrates how to create a basic time series chart in Excel to visualize data trends over time, a fundamental step in forecasting. The chart displays "Vehicles" data plotted against timestamps from "31-12-2015 02:00" to "31-12-2015 23:00", showing fluctuations in vehicle counts throughout the day. To create this chart, you would select the date and vehicle count columns, then choose a line chart option from the "Insert" tab in Excel. Analyzing this chart helps identify patterns like daily peaks and lows, which are crucial for making informed forecasts. By understanding how to visualize time series data, students can effectively analyze historical trends and build forecasting models in Excel.ate a time series chart in Excel to visualize data trends, a crucial step in forecasting. The x-axis represents the time intervals (in this case, hours of the day), and the y-axis represents the corresponding values (number of vehicles). By plotting the data in this way, students can observe patterns, seasonality, and outliers, which are essential for choosing an appropriate forecasting model. This visualization technique helps in understanding the underlying data before applying any forecasting methods. This skill provides a foundation for students to explore relationships and trends in their own datasets, a very important concept in the realm of forecasting.)](https://youtu.be/QrTimmxwZw4)
