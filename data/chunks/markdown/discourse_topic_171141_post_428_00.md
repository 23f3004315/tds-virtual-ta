## Post #428 by 22f2000526

Before the project evaluation, I ran the test script and successfully passed all Task A and Task B checks. I also built the Docker image as required.

But, when you gus evaluated , I get the following error:docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: “uvicorn”: executable file not found in $PATH: unknown.

Could you please help me understand why this is happening even though the evaluation script ran fine?
