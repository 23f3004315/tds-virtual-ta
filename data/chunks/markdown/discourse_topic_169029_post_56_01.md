You do not need to do the task as the GA required.

Does this mean this type of question wonâ€™t be paramaterized?

**[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image captures a question posed by a student in the TDS Solver Project 2 discussion thread. The student is following instructions that involve installing and running Visual Studio Code, and then running the command `code -s` in their terminal or command prompt, with the instruction to copy/paste the full output of the command. The student's specific question is "What is the output of `code -s`?", indicating they've executed the command but are unclear about the meaning of or expectations for the printed output, or potentially they have not received an output they consider useful. The question aims to clarify the expected result of the given terminal command `code -s`.ovide the student with the expected output, helping them to diagnose any potential issues or gain a better understanding of the tool." alt="Screenshot 2025-03-18 at 5.17.35 PM" data-base62-sha1="7ZqMJhtNxRCkHEwzdP4Z5yRfDUB" width="690" height="46" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image shows part of an instructor's directions or example, likely from a Project 2 assignment thread on the TDS Solver. It instructs students to install and run Visual Studio Code. Then, within their terminal or command prompt, they should type `code -s` and press Enter. The instructions then ask them to copy and paste the entire output resulting from that command. Finally, the prompt explicitly asks "What is the output of code -s?", likely to guide students in understanding or submitting a specific result., **[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image captures a student question within the "Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread," specifically referencing post #56. The instructor's instruction is to install and run Visual Studio Code, then execute the command `code -s` in the terminal (or command prompt), and copy the entire output. The student's confusion is manifested in their explicit question: "What is the output of `code -s`?". This indicates the student is either unsure what to expect as a result, or perhaps encountered an error and is seeking clarification. The intended outcome is for the student to provide the output from running the `code -s` command, allowing the instructor to assess if the student's environment is properly configured. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image captures a student's question within a project discussion thread. The initial instructions direct students to install and run VS Code, then execute the command `code -s` in the terminal. The student then asks what the output of the command `code -s` is, showing they are uncertain about the result of this command. This highlights a moment of confusion as the student seeks clarification on the expected terminal output after running the provided command. There is no provided answer, so it is unclear if this confusion was resolved. 2x" data-dominant-color="2A2C31">
