**Q12: Should I take the programming diploma along with the data science diploma?**

**A12:** Programming skills are very valuable. The two diplomas complement each other.

**Q13: What are some standard tools I should focus on?**

**A13:** Bash has been around since the 1970s. Focus on newer tools and techniques, such as LLMs and GPTs, which are powerful and in high demand.

**A14:** Learn by using the tools frequently in your workflows. The instructors will provide more support sessions.

**Q15: Can we have sessions on installing the Linux system?**

**A15:** The instructors will discuss this with the TAs and schedule sessions if needed. Note that you may not need to install a full Linux system; Google Colab provides a Linux environment.

**Q16: Will the sessions be added to the Google Calendar?**

**A16:** Yes, they will be added to a playlist on the Google Calendar. Bookmark the TDS channel to easily find the playlist. The videos themselves will be on YouTube.

**Q17: Can you request the programming faculty to add content similar to TDS to the programming diploma?**

**A17:** Post this request on Discourse and tag the relevant people.

**Q18: What is a "take-home open internet" project?**

**A18:** You'll receive a dataset and questions. You can use any resources to answer the questions.

**A19:** Project 1 will cover the first four or five modules. Project 2 will cover a wider range of topics.

**Q20: I have a basic understanding of the tools, but not a great one. Should I continue or drop the course?**

**A20:** If you can solve the problems, that's good enough. The course is meant to introduce you to the tools, not make you an expert. Focus on the new tools and techniques. You can always get certifications for other skills later.
