 report, which makes sense. Based on this behavior and the details in the shared report, I’d like to confirm: during the re-evaluation, was the request payload indeed sent with both question and file fields included in the form-data?

For reference, I’ve attached a screenshot demonstrating the response.

**[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** The image shows a JSON response from the TDS solver API during Project 2 discussions, indicating a problem the student is facing. The response is an array of objects, each representing a test case. For multiple test cases (GA1_q18, GA4_q6, GA2_q3, GA3_q2, GA5_q7), the API returns a "FAILED" status and an "HTTP 400" error with the message "Missing question or file". This suggests that the student's code is not sending the necessary question or file data to the API endpoint for these tests, leading to the server rejecting the requests. This is most likely a student question, as the error messages indicate a configuration or coding issue. The student needs to review how they are constructing the API requests and ensure that both the question and file data are being correctly included in the request body.valuvation-report" data-base62-sha1="yZmfCDuuTQRlI8lj1kpewzC8XEP" width="486" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** The image depicts a student facing an issue with their TDS Solver project, showing output from an API call. The output is a JSON array where each object represents a test case. Each test case includes the API endpoint, test code (e.g., "GA1_q18"), a "FAILED" status, and an HTTP 400 error with the message "Missing question or file". This indicates that the student's requests to the API are failing because either the question or the associated file required for the test case is not being sent correctly to the API endpoint. This highlights a potential issue in how the student is constructing and sending the API requests, particularly regarding the data payload., **[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image depicts a JSON array showing the results of multiple API calls to "https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/". Each object in the array represents a test case, identified by a "test_code" like "GA1_q18," "GA4_q6," etc. The "status" for each test is "FAILED," and the "error" field indicates an HTTP 400 error with the message "Missing question or file." This suggests the student's code is sending requests that are missing either the question data or the file required by the API endpoint, which needs to be investigated and fixed by ensuring the request payload includes necessary data. The error message indicates that the API expects a 'question' parameter and/or a file upload, which are not currently being sent, which is a critical troubleshooting step. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image depicts a student posting their error messages related to the TDS solver project. The output shows a JSON-like structure containing multiple API calls to "https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/". Each API call has a "test_code" like "GA1_q18" and consistently returns a "status": "FAILED" along with the error message "HTTP 400: {\"error\":\"Missing question or file\"}". This suggests a potential problem with the question or file being uploaded or accessed by the API, indicating a need to review how the question data is being passed or stored for these specific test codes. The student is likely seeking help understanding and resolving this consistent "Missing question or file" error. This looks like a peer discussion post for help or guidance. 2x" data-dominant-color="080808">re-evaluvation-report1636×1680 311 KB
