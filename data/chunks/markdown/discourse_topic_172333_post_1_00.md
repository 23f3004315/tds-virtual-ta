Mock Exam: Tools in Data Science
The end term and the mock has been created using the TDS GPT Assistant. Since the GPT has ALL the GAs, Course Content Modules, Live Session Transcriptions (its works like RAG), it is really able to help you prepare for the end term. Use it!
Therefore you can also create your own mocks.
