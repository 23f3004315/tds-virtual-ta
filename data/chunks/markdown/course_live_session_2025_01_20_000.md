# Live Session: 20 Jan 2025

[**[Course Image: 2025-01-20 Week 2 - Session 1 - TDS Jan 25]** The image represents the content for "Week 2, Session 1" of the TDS (likely The Data Science) course, scheduled on January 20, 2025. This session is part of a broader curriculum that deepens the understanding of Machine Learning projects. The abstract icons represent core concepts, and data visualization is expected in this segment. Students can anticipate learning about applying those core concepts to the project. This session builds on the foundational knowledge gained in Week 1. Week 2, Session 1 in the TDS course, dated January 20, 2025. The session likely covers core concepts and tools relevant to machine learning projects, indicated by the surrounding context and the illustrative data-related icons. Students can expect to delve into topics building upon the foundations established in Week 1. The session aims to equip them with practical knowledge and skills applicable to real-world TDS projects and assignments. Further details regarding the specific content will be presented during the live session itself.)](https://youtu.be/aJnygTpma7M)

**Q1: What is an ML project, and how does it compare to the "fitting of six models" project?**

**A1:** An ML (Machine Learning) project involves more factors than just fitting models. The "fitting of six models" project was a simplified version done for a friend's certification course. It involved training six models on a pre-cleaned dataset with some hyperparameter tuning but minimal data preprocessing or cleaning.

**Q2: Is the TDS project designed to provide a level playing field for everyone, considering some participants may lack coding experience?**

**A2:** The TDS project aims to combine everything learned in the course so far. It might seem challenging, especially for those without a coding background. The project requires creating an application with specific endpoints, pushing it to GitHub, creating a Docker file, and submitting it through a Google form. However, the course is designed to bridge the technical gap for non-technical participants, preparing them for industry standards. The instructors will provide support through dedicated sessions, and students are encouraged to use resources like ChatGPT and YouTube videos.

**Q3: What are the main components of the TDS project, and what tools are involved?**
