The IMDB and weather questions was a pain along with the 10th question, wasted so much time @s.anand , the questions were nowhere tough, it was the problems with the evaluation part i had spend hours just to sit and correct the JSON file and no comments on the 10th questionâ€™s part.

I am fine with the academia being challenging to study not the evalation making me manually edit solutions
