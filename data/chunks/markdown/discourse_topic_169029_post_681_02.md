 codes. The student is likely seeking help understanding and resolving this consistent "Missing question or file" error. This looks like a peer discussion post for help or guidance. 2x" data-dominant-color="080808">re-evaluvation-report1636×1680 311 KB

**[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image shows a student's attempt to submit a request to the fileqa-app.vercel.app/api endpoint using a tool like Postman, in the context of a TDS project. The student is sending a POST request with form-data, including a 'file' (abcd.zip) but is missing the 'question' parameter as indicated by the unchecked box next to the 'question' key. The application returns a "400 Bad Request" error with the message "error: Missing question or file", indicating that either the question or the file is not being sent correctly. The student is attempting to debug why they are receiving this error when they believe they are sending the file. The UI elements visible include the URL, request method (POST), parameter keys and values, the "Send" button, and the error response.g it because the corresponding checkbox for the field is not selected. This shows a student question related to troubleshooting an API request and interpreting server responses, indicating a peer discussion around potential resolution." alt="Screenshot at Apr 17 18-34-30" data-base62-sha1="s5Wxy6jvzaExPR8vz4EeaEFzQey" width="690" height="332" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image depicts a student's attempt to send a POST request to the `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` endpoint using a tool like Postman or Insomnia, showing a student question/issue. The student is sending the request with the "form-data" content type, including a "file" with the name "abcd.zip" and a "question" field. However, the checkbox next to the "question" key is unchecked, implying that the question parameter is not actually being sent in the request. As a result, the server responds with a "400 Bad Request" error, and the JSON response body contains the error message `{"error": "Missing question or file"}`. This indicates that the student needs to ensure that the "question" parameter is properly included in the request to resolve the error., **[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image depicts a student's troubleshooting process using a tool like Postman or Insomnia to interact with an API endpoint `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`. The student is making a POST request, attempting to send both a "question" (a text query asking "What is the value in the answer column of the...") and a "file" named "abcd.zip" within the request body, using the `form-data` content type. However, the "question" field is not selected, meaning it will not be sent in the request. The server responds with a "400 Bad Request" error, specifically indicating "Missing question or file", shown in the JSON response body. This indicates the student is missing a required parameter in their request which is causing the "evaluation" (likely referring to a testing suite for the API) to fail. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23ds3000090]** This image is a screenshot from a student's post showing their attempt to send a POST request to `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` using a tool that looks like Postman or Insomnia. The student configured the request with the "form-data" body type, including a "question" field with a text value and a "file" field uploading "abcd.zip." The "question" parameter is visible in the Key column but the box beside it is unchecked. The server returns a "400 Bad Request" error with the JSON response `{"error": "Missing question or file"}`. This indicates that the student's request failed because the server requires both the "question" and "file" parameters, but the request was sent without "question" being active. The student is experiencing the same error as the evaluation. 2x" data-dominant-color="FAF8F8">Screenshot at Apr 17 18-34-301938×934 130 KB
