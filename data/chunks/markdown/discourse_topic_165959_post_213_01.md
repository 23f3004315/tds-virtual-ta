I didn’t get any error for Astana.

The error may be due to incorrect loops in your code that’s why it’s going out of range, check for that.

**[Discussion Image by 23f1001231]** This image shows a student's attempt to convert a pandas DataFrame `df` to a JSON string with the `orient='records'` parameter in a Google Colab notebook named "bbc-weather-scraping.ipynb". The DataFrame displays scraped BBC weather data, including date, high/low temperatures, and summary descriptions (e.g., "Thick cloud and a gentle breeze"). The notebook displays the DataFrame tabular output, followed by the output from the `df.to_json(orient='records')` command. The output is a JSON string representation of the DataFrame, where each record (row) is represented as a JSON object within a list; however, unicode escape characters like `\u00b0` and `\u80b0` are present for degree symbols, indicating a potential encoding issue that requires further cleaning or encoding specification.lity issue. This implies the student might be seeking help on how to correctly encode or handle these special characters when converting the DataFrame to JSON." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="9u7p40Le1BFXBD6yPqSHtYk9VZ" width="690" height="260" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1001231]** This image depicts a student's code execution within a Google Colab notebook named "bbc-weather-scraping.ipynb," related to a TDS (The Data School) discussion on GA4 data sourcing. The notebook contains a DataFrame displaying weather data, including date, high temperature, low temperature, and summary, for dates ranging from 25-02-16 to 25-02-22. Below this DataFrame, the student has executed the code `df.to_json(orient='records')` to convert the DataFrame into a JSON string. The resulting JSON string is visible, showing the data structured as a list of records, where each record contains weather information for a specific date. The string displays unicode characters, specifically `\u00b0`, which appear to be related to encoding the degree symbol., **[Discussion Image by 23f1001231]** This image captures part of a student's Python code in a Google Colab notebook named "bbc-weather-scraping.ipynb," likely part of the TDS GA4 course "Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]". The code cell displays the output of converting a DataFrame (presumably named `df`) to JSON format using the `.to_json(orient='records')` method, and the output is shown in the records format which means each row of the dataframe is represented as JSON. The JSON data includes fields like "Date", "High", "Low", and "Summary", providing weather data like "25-02-09", "High":"-10\\u00b0", which represents the High temperature, and the summary description of the weather that day. It is difficult to tell from the image alone, but it appears to be an example of the expected outcome of running the code. The student is likely referring to this image when discussing the code's result, or potentially seeking guidance on any unexpected output they are seeing. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1001231]** This image captures a student's coding activity within a Google Colab notebook named "bbc-weather-scraping.ipynb," showing the data frame's `.to_json` output using the `orient='records'` argument. The code cell displays the command `df.to_json(orient='records')` and its output, which is a JSON string representing weather data, including "Date", "High", "Low", and "Summary" fields for each record. The temperatures contain unicode escape sequences like `\u00b0`, likely representing the degree symbol, which may indicate a formatting issue or potential encoding problem that the student might be encountering. The presence of "Next steps" buttons suggests that the student is following a guided exercise or tutorial, and the available options include "Generate code with df," "View recommended plots," and "New interactive sheet". 2x" data-dominant-color="272032">image1860×703 133 KB
