o do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of `evaluate.py`. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general *idea* of the task.

This where I need help, i tried doing with agentic framework but i failed with the model in llm proxy, which was highly suspect because, that model should have known what the uv framework but it seemed to me to be outdated. Hence executing code Interpreter tools failed as the model gave outdated code. I have raised this issue before

Hence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust.

I just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project). This general function is what i need help with. Please kindly do the needful.
