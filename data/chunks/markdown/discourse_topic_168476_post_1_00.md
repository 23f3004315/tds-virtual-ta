Dear @jkmadathil @Anand @Bharathi

First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the **TDS team** in supporting us throughout this course. The **live sessions and guidance** have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.

However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.

**Key Challenges Faced**
 **Lack of Prerequisites**
This course did not list any **prerequisites**, leading many students—including those from **non-technical backgrounds**—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the **course content, assignments, and projects** have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.

**Project Complexity &amp; Deadline Pressure**
The **difficulty of the projects** has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to **rely heavily on peer support** just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.
