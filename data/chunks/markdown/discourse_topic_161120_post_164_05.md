**[Discussion Image by 22f3000657]** This image shows a student's web browser displaying the JSON response from a local API endpoint, `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=3Q`. The JSON represents a list of students in class "3Q", with each student object containing a "studentId" and "class" field. The response includes entries for students with IDs 68, 838, 902, 1006, 1623, 1784, 1834, 1893, and 1931, all belonging to class "3Q". The context suggests this is part of a peer discussion in a "Deployment Tools" course where the student is likely testing or troubleshooting their API endpoint. The "Pretty-print" label indicates the browser or an extension has formatted the JSON for better readability.ikely part of a student assignment or project during the deployment tools course, possibly demonstrating API integration.

The response is a JSON object with a key "students", which contains an array of student objects. Each student object has a "studentId" and "class" field, with the class consistently being "3Q". This API call is part of the GA2 deployment tools assignment and the student is verifying the API response for the "3Q" class. The information likely represents the data returned from a backend service based on a class query., **[Discussion Image by 22f3000657]** This image depicts the output of an API request made by a student in the TDS Jan 2025 cohort, within the "GA2 - Deployment Tools - Discussion Thread". The student is accessing the endpoint `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=3Q` in their browser, which returns a JSON response. The JSON data contains a "students" array, which is a list of objects. Each object represents a student and includes their "studentId" and "class", with all "class" values set to "3Q". The display of the JSON implies the student is likely testing or inspecting the data returned by their API endpoint as part of a deployment exercise. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f3000657]** This image captures a student's view of a JSON response from a web API endpoint, specifically within a discussion thread about deployment tools. The student is likely attempting to retrieve student data for a particular class, "3Q," as indicated by the URL `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=3Q`. The response is formatted as a JSON object with a "students" array, where each element is an object containing a "studentId" and "class" attribute, the student id being an integer and the class as "3Q". This representation indicates a successful API call and data retrieval, suggesting the student is examining the data structure rather than encountering an error. The discussion might be around how to parse or use this JSON data within their application deployment setup, or perhaps comparing the JSON format with other data formats they might encounter during the deployment process. The image thus represents a step in a debugging or data verification process, where the student is checking the response from the API. 2x" data-dominant-color="181818">image1919Ã—1079 185 KB
