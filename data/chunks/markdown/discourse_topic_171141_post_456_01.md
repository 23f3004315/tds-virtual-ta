**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image captures data from a TDS student project submission, seemingly displayed in a tabular format within a discussion forum or code repository interface. Specifically, it displays a student's entry (identified by email 22f3003083@ds.study.itm.ac.in) and relevant submission details timestamped 2/16/2025 23:20:17. The columns present the student's GitHub repository link, which is https://github.com/22f3003083/TDS_Project_1, and the student's DockerHub image name, which is 22f3003083/v1, presumably in response to instructor prompts asking for this information. The interface includes a search bar with "22f3003083/v1" already entered and tabs for "Preview," "Code," and "Blame" as well as the number of lines, file size, and buttons for "Raw," copy to clipboard, download, edit, and dropdown menu.tudent provided for project 1, including the Github and Dockerhub links/names." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="tzymtAyX9jKKvQKR6pxbORjcMES" width="690" height="94" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image depicts a table showing student responses to questions related to Project 1, likely captured from a database or spreadsheet within the TDS (The Data Science) learning platform. The table's columns are labeled "Timestamp," "Email Address," "What is the link to your Github repository which has the code for Project 1?" and "What is the name of the image published on DockerHub?". Row 932 shows a submission made on "2/16/2025 23:20:17" by a student with the email address "22f3003083@ds.study.itm.ac.in," providing the GitHub repository link "https://github.com/22f3003083/TDS_Project_1" and the DockerHub image name "22f3003083/v1". The search bar above the table contains the query "22f3003083/v1," indicating that the student or instructor is searching for submissions related to this specific DockerHub image. This likely represents a peer discussion or instructor review of submitted student projects and their associated links and DockerHub details., **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image is a table showing student submission data for Project 1 in the TDS course, specifically the Github repository URL and DockerHub image name. The table includes columns for Timestamp, Email Address, GitHub repository link, and the DockerHub image name. The submission data shown corresponds to the email address "22f3003083@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" with a GitHub repository URL of "https://github.com/22f3003083/TDS_Project_1" and DockerHub image named "22f3003083/v1." The student likely searched for their id "22f3003083/v1" in the table to confirm their submission details. This helps students verify their submitted links and names align with course requirements, resolving potential confusion around incorrect submissions. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image displays a single row from what appears to be a table or a spreadsheet, likely part of a student assignment submission review process for "TDS Project 1". The row provides information about a specific student (identified by email address `22f3003083@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`), including the timestamp of their submission (2/16/2025 23:20:17), the link to their GitHub repository (`https://github.com/22f3003083/TDS_Project_1`), and the name of the DockerHub image (`22f3003083/v1`). A search bar at the top of the interface shows the student ID being searched `22f3003083/v1`. The table headers are "Timestamp", "Email Address", "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1?" and "What is the name of the image published on DockerHub?". 2x" data-dominant-color="191E25">image1829Ã—251 22 KB
