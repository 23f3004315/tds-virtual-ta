**[Discussion Image by 22f2001590]** This image shows the task instructions for a project, likely related to web scraping and data processing. The instructions detail how to source data from IMDb's advanced search, filter movie titles based on ratings between 2 and 8, and format the extracted information (ID, title, year, rating) into a JSON structure for the first 25 titles, with the movie ID found after "tt" in the URL's `href` attribute, accompanied by an example JSON format. The final step instructs the user to submit the JSON data into a specified text box. It serves as the problem definition for the task, and future students could use this to understand the input data structure and task requirements. search to access movie data, filter for titles with a rating between 2 and 8, and extract the first 25 titles' ID (from the URL after "tt" in the href attribute), title, year, and rating. The extracted data needs to be organized into a JSON structure as shown in the example: `[ { "id": "tt1234567", "title": "Movie 1", "year": "2021", "rating": "5.8"}, { "id": "tt7654321", "title": "Movie 2", "year": "2019", "rating": "6.2"}, // ... more titles ]`. Finally, the JSON data should be submitted in the text box below. This provides context for student questions and discussion regarding the project requirements and formatting." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="pomzfXjUuFhneq5rHaGWmJ5SxJt" width="690" height="400" data-dominant-color="24292F">image698Ã—405 17.4 KB
