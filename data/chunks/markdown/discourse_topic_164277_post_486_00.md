Hi ,

I am trying to build using both docker and podman but it failed on both. I have watched many videos trying to resolve this adn also chatgpt in order to resolve the issue but it seems to persist. I even uninstalled and reinstalled both podman and doceker multiple times but no help.

When i run command docker build -t ___________ .

the error that comes is :

Dockerfile:2
1 | # Use a lightweight Python image

2 | &gt;&gt;&gt; FROM python:3.12-slim

3 |
