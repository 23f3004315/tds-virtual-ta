.

Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’.

I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither `respect` nor `kindness` is evident in your post.

But thank you for your feedback.

One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score.

And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.

Kind regards,

TDS team
