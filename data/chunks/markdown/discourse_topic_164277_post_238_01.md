**[Discussion Image by 23f2001286]** This image shows a student's terminal output in VS Code, where they're attempting to use `sudo` commands within a Linux environment, likely WSL, for a project related to TDS Jan 2025. The student is encountering issues with password authentication, repeatedly getting "Sorry, try again" after entering their password, eventually hitting the limit and receiving "3 incorrect password attempts". The commands the student is trying to execute are `sudo apt update`, `sudo passwd`, and `sudo apt install -y podman`, indicating an attempt to update the package manager and install podman, and possibly change the user password. The core problem is password authentication failure preventing administrative tasks. The file path in the terminal indicates the student is working within the TDS/Project directory.g to execute commands from the `/mnt/d/TDS/Project` directory, as shown in the terminal prompt. The student likely needs to either reset their password or ensure they are entering the correct password for their user account (ayushcodes2611) when prompted by `sudo`." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="uanLPgzih2sckRlTm7brBjpnJxS" width="690" height="153" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2001286]** This image depicts a student's interaction with the terminal in VS Code, specifically during Project 1 of the TDS January 2025 cohort.

The student encountered multiple "Sorry, try again." and "sudo: a password is required" errors, indicating incorrect password entries and subsequent lockouts due to multiple failed attempts. The error "sudo: 3 incorrect password attempts" is also displayed before the prompt reappears, signaling that the student needs to verify their password and try again later.

The terminal displays the error message "Sorry, try again." after multiple password attempts, and after 3 failed attempts, the message "sudo: 3 incorrect password attempts" appears, followed by "sudo: a password is required".
