Hi,

I am not able to understand how to do the Project 1. The date is also very near.

The problem I am facing is, When I did the Modules the page was different, but now in the Project 1 I am not getting any section to submit the project.

Please let me know where are the questions and how tot submit that.

The deadline is near.
