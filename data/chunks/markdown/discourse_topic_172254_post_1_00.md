**“Students are allowed to take help from their pets in completing assignments.”**

So I did.

*Confession: My Labrador Did All My Assignments* 
Yes, I got **great marks** in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1.

But let’s be real…

It was **my Labrador** who did the actual work

While I was snoozing through deadlines, he was:

Solving **deployment issues** faster than my dev server boots
Writing **function calling code** like a true GPT whisperer
Fixing **LLM bugs** that I didn’t even understand

Meanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket.

He growled at broken APIs.

I took the credit.

“Thank you all for an awesome semester!

I learned more than some juniors. From containerization to prompt tuning.

But I am **personally offended** by one thing…”

[Quote]: 
“How dare you give **bonus marks on Week 7**?

I skipped it — just like many — because we were told *only best 4 of 7 would count*.

I demand justice. And a belly rub.”
