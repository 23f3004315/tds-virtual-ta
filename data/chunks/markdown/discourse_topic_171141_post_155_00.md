I have submitted my Project 1, and my GitHub repository meets all the listed requirements. However, I received a FAIL for the check:

“Is Dockerfile present in root of GitHub repo?”

Despite this, my dockerfile is present in the root directory of my repository.

Github repo link: GitHub - Vansh-22f300/project_tds

My evaluation.log , contains the score .

Roll no : 22f3001851
