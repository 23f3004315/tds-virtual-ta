**[Discussion Image by Sourabhraj]** This image captures a student's troubleshooting question within the TDS student discussion forum related to Project 1 in the TDS Jan 2025 cohort. The student is encountering a `ModuleNotFoundError` when running their `/app/app.py` script, specifically stating that the `fastapi` module cannot be found. The traceback indicates the error occurs on line 11, where the code attempts to import `FastAPI` from the `fastapi` package. This signifies the student likely has not installed the `fastapi` library in their environment, which is a prerequisite for running the application that depends on it, showing a dependency management issue. Resolution would involve advising the student to use `pip install fastapi` (and potentially `uvicorn` if needed).tapi'` occurring when running `/app/app.py`, specifically at line 11 where the code attempts `from fastapi import FastAPI`. This suggests the student has not installed the `fastapi` library in their environment, which is necessary to run the application. A typical solution would involve using `pip install fastapi` in the environment where the app is being executed. This error is a common setup issue, signifying that the student needs to ensure all project dependencies are installed before running the code." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="hQAeppzCT6UMjxo679DbUO4hU8d" width="656" height="116">image656Ã—116 3.28 KB
