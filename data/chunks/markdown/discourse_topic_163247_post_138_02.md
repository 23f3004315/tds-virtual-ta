I had used (well gpt) the below two decorators to format:

`class SearchRequest(BaseModel):
 docs: List[str] # The list of documents to search through
 query: str # The search query string

class SearchResponse(BaseModel):
 matches: List[str] # The list of matched documents

.........

@app.post("/similarity", response_model=SearchResponse)

.........

return SearchResponse(matches=sorted_matches[:3])
`
It basically checks the Request and Response formatting. This worked for me. Hope it helps. And thanks btw for mentioning using POSTMAN, as I had never used it before, so it clicked in my mind after reading your post only that I can basically debug using POSTMAN. Thank you for that
