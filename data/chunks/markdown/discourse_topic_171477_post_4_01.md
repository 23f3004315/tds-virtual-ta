 the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails:

The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.)
The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository

Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:

**[Discussion Image by 23f2000345]** This image is an email from course staff (22t1 se2002 ) to a student providing the results of their Project 1 docker image submission, and initiates a peer discussion, since the user forwarded the mail in the forum for help from others. The email lists several files generated during the evaluation, including "Evaluation log file," "Docker log file," "Server start log file," "Evaluation script file," "Data generation file," "Docker orchestration file," and "Solution script." Crucially, it warns that a "MISSING" indicator means the evaluation failed because the file wasn't available due to a misconfigured docker image or evaluation failure, resulting in a score of 0. The email specifies the Docker image should become responsive within 5 minutes, and the evaluation environment uses an 8-core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit with 1 Gigabit network bandwidth, where image ID is listed as 'b0d89eee9b17'. Students have until Tuesday to report any discrepancies or bugs.ip attachment). The evaluation uses a specific Docker image with ID `b0d89eee9b17`.

The email indicates that some files are "MISSING," resulting in a score of 0, which means the evaluation either failed to run or the Docker image was misconfigured. The email lists seven files related to the evaluation, including links to "Evaluation log file" and "Docker log file" hosted on Google Drive and specifies that server start log, evaluation script, data generation, Docker orchestration, and solution script files are included as attachments. The email also highlights the performance requirements of the Docker image (becoming responsive within 5 minutes) and describes the server environment used for evaluation (8 core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit with 1 Gigabit network bandwidth). It encourages students to report bugs or discrepancies in the scripts by the following Tuesday., **[Discussion Image by 23f2000345]** This email is an automated instructor response providing feedback on a student's Project 1 docker image submission, including initial scores. The email explains that "MISSING" indicates a file unavailable because the evaluation didn't run or the docker image was misconfigured, which will result in a score of 0. It notes the importance of the Docker image being responsive within 5 minutes and provides the specifications of the server used for evaluation (8 core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit, 1 Gigabit dedicated network bandwidth). The email lists several files for review, including two Google Drive links to the "Evaluation log file" and "Docker log file", as well as attachments for "Server start log file", "Evaluation script file", "Data generation file", "Docker orchestration file", and a zipped "Solution script." The message concludes by stating the scores are not final, gives a deadline for reporting problems, and mentions a final marking schema to come. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2000345]** This is an email from the course staff (se2002@study.iitm.ac.in) providing feedback on a student's Project 1 Docker image submission. The email lists several files related to the evaluation, including "Evaluation log file" and "Docker log file" accessible via Google Drive links, plus "Server start log file", "Evaluation script file", "Data generation file", "Docker orchestration file", and "Solution script" as attachments. The email states that "MISSING" indicates a file wasn't available, possibly due to evaluation issues or misconfiguration, and would result in a score of 0. The email also specifies that the Docker image should be responsive within 5 minutes of launch, mentioning the server's specifications (8 core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit, 1 Gigabit network bandwidth), and shares the Docker image ID. Students are given a deadline to report any discrepancies or bugs in the scripts, after which the scores will be finalized. The email thus provides an evaluation report with links and attachments, specifying performance criteria, error handling, and reporting deadlines. 2x" data-dominant-color="F1F1F2">First Evaluation Email1511Ã—724 76.2 KB
