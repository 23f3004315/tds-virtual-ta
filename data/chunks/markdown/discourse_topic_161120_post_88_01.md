The student has entered a URL (partially obscured) into some tool or application, which resulted in a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error. This indicates a problem with the network request, such as the server not being accessible at that address, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues if the request is coming from a different domain, or an incorrect URL format. The surrounding text indicates instructions to enable CORS and that the submission will be tested by sending requests with the `?class=` query parameter. Therefore, the student is likely troubleshooting their API setup based on the provided specifications.student question since the student is attempting to determine the correct URL, as per the instructions." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-26 184204" data-base62-sha1="lpsUWEe1rrC5TCttCGTUxxrfb0v" width="690" height="187" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image captures a student's attempt to determine the FastAPI API endpoint, potentially in response to instructions about implementing a query parameter for filtering students by class (e.g., `/api?class=1A`). The student enters a URL into a field, but receives a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error, indicating a problem with the network request. The surrounding text provides context on enabling CORS to handle GET requests and hints at the expected endpoint structure (http://127.0.0.1:8000/api).

The instructions emphasize the need to enable CORS to handle GET requests and suggest the API URL endpoint might resemble `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. However, the student is encountering a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error when trying to access the URL, indicating a potential issue with the endpoint being unavailable, CORS configuration, or network connectivity. The instructor/TA mentions that they'll verify the URL by sending a request with a "?class=..." parameter to ensure the response matches the expected data, likely to isolate the problem. This snippet exemplifies a troubleshooting process where students test API endpoints, face common errors, and rely on the instructors' guidance to resolve them. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image captures a student's question about the FastAPI API endpoint for their GA2 deployment assignment, accompanied by a troubleshooting scenario. The assignment instructions state that the API should return students based on the 'class' query parameter, for example `/api?class=1A` or `/api?class=1A&class=1B`, respecting the order in the CSV file, and that CORS should be enabled. The student attempted to access the API endpoint but received a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error, suggesting a problem with network connectivity or the server not being reachable. A follow-up comment indicates that the instructor plans to test the URL by adding the "?class=..." query parameter and verifying the returned data. 2x" data-dominant-color="282E36">Screenshot 2025-01-26 1842041661Ã—452 47.1 KB
