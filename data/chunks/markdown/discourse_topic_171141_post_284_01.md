**[Discussion Image by _0_Aryan]** This image shows an email from the "TDS Team" outlining Project 1 prerequisites and evaluations. The email states that to pass the prerequisites, the GitHub repository must exist and be publicly accessible, have a LICENSE file with the MIT license, contain a valid Dockerfile, the Docker image must be publicly accessible and runnable via a `podman run` command, and the Docker image should use the same Dockerfile as in the repository. The email shows that the student's Docker image is present in Docker Hub and is public, the GitHub repo is present and public, and the Dockerfile is present in the root of the GitHub repo, all of which pass. However, the MIT license is not present at the root of the GitHub repo, causing the overall prerequisites to fail and the Project 1 score to be 0.iled, causing the overall "Prerequisites" to fail and the "Project 1 Score" to be 0, despite Dockerfile, github repo, and docker image being present and public. This email serves as an automated check to ensure that the project setup meets the minimum requirements for evaluation." alt="1000050348" data-base62-sha1="z13Ubyd03fcUA0Wfe6tP2tcsDw2" width="230" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by _0_Aryan]** This image shows an email from the TDS team outlining the prerequisite checks for Project 1. It details five requirements for the GitHub repository and Docker image, including public accessibility, the presence of a LICENSE file (MIT license), a valid Dockerfile, successful execution via podman run with specified environment variables, and consistency between the Docker image's Dockerfile and the one in the repository. The email also presents a checklist of prerequisite evaluations, indicating that the Docker image and GitHub repo are present and public, the Dockerfile is present, but the MIT license is missing, resulting in a "FAIL" for prerequisites and a Project 1 Score of 0. The email directs students to the TDS Project 1: Evaluation page for more details and instructs them to contact the course team if needed. It appears that the student is confused about the discrepancies between the passing checks and the overall failing grade, likely related to the missing MIT license., **[Discussion Image by _0_Aryan]** This image shows an email from the TDS team, specifically regarding Project 1 prerequisite evaluations and appears to be an instructor notification. The email lists five requirements for Project 1, including a publicly accessible GitHub repository with an MIT license and a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image that runs via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`, and ensuring that the Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository. The email then presents a checklist showing the student's evaluation results: Docker image present/public (PASS), GitHub repo present/public (PASS), Dockerfile present (PASS), and MIT license present (FAIL), resulting in an overall failure of prerequisites and a Project 1 score of 0. The student is therefore missing the MIT License file in the root of their GitHub repository. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by _0_Aryan]** This image shows an email from the TDS Team to a learner, detailing the prerequisites for Project 1 and the results of an automated evaluation. The email outlines five requirements: a public GitHub repository, an MIT license file, a valid Dockerfile, a publicly accessible Docker image that runs via a specific `podman run` command, and that the Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repo. The evaluation results show the Docker image and GitHub repo passing, but the MIT license failing, which causes the overall prerequisites to fail and the project score to be 0. The `podman run` command includes environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN` and port mapping `-p 8000:8000` along with the `$IMAGE_NAME`. The student needs to ensure they have an MIT license file named "LICENSE" in the root of their GitHub repository to pass the check. 2x" data-dominant-color="252529">10000503481080Ã—2340 154 KB
