Dear Sir,

In my course dashboard, Project 2 score is shown as zero. However, I had submitted the repository and API endpoints (http://35.192.157.22.80) through the Google Form. I had received a mail to make edit in API end point if changed. I had edited my api end point by adding /api/ and it was http://35.192.157.22/api/. My server was running fine. I have worked hard to do this project and now receiving a score of zero. Kindly look into it.
