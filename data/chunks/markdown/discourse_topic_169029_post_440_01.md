**[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** This image, posted in a student discussion thread for "Project 2 - TDS Solver," depicts a browser error screen. The screen displays the message "Aw, Snap! Something went wrong while displaying this webpage," indicating a problem rendering the page. The specific error code given is "Out of Memory," which suggests the browser ran out of available memory while attempting to load or process the content. The image is a potential student question regarding this error, and they are seeking guidance to troubleshoot this problem. This issue likely arises from large data sets or inefficient memory management in the TDS solver code.yed error message "Aw, Snap! Something went wrong while displaying this webpage." is accompanied by the specific error code "Out of Memory". This "Out of Memory" error suggests that the browser or the underlying process ran out of available memory, possibly due to large datasets, inefficient code, or resource-intensive computations within the TDS solver implementation. The error is displayed within the web browser's interface, indicating that it's a runtime issue, and includes a "Learn more" link, potentially leading to browser-specific troubleshooting information. Based on this context from the TDS discussion thread, students facing similar "Out of Memory" errors can focus on optimizing their code, reducing memory usage, or increasing the available memory allocated to the browser." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="aI57T4M00sh9lNyRobLzSz7bJyk" width="620" height="499" data-dominant-color="FDF9FD">image712Ã—574 6.41 KB
