## Post #2 by carlton

@22f3001561 GA5 like all the prior GAs for TDS Jan 25 term were all to be submitted through the graded assignment page. Which is in the link provided (it is actually in the screen shot you have provided).

All the previous GA 1 through 4 were also exactly the same.

We have no evidence you ever submitted any of the other GAs except GA1.

Kind regards
