**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image shows a table from a TDS student project discussion, outlining the results of automated checks on a student's submission. The table includes columns for email ("22f3000118@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"), URL ("dog/diya" or a GitHub repository link), result ("FAIL" or "OK"), type (Docker, Repo, License, Dockerfile, Clone), and a message explaining the result. Several checks passed ("OK" for Repo, License, and Clone), while others failed ("FAIL" for Docker and Dockerfile), indicating issues with the Docker setup; specifically, "No public DockerHub image" and "No Dockerfile" are reported. This appears to be a system feedback table for students to debug their code submission. The table format itself provides troubleshooting information, as students can use the messages to diagnose and fix problems with their project's Docker configuration and repository structure.L with message "No Dockerfile"), and a Clone check (OK with message "Cloned"). The student's repository is hosted on GitHub at the URL "https://github.com/22f3000118/Project-1" and the failed Docker image check points to a potential issue with the student's DockerHub repository or its visibility settings. The absence of a Dockerfile, as indicated by the failed "Dockerfile" check, suggests the student might be missing a crucial component for building a Docker image from the project code, which would cause a failure with the automated grading." alt="Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 11.24.19 pm" data-base62-sha1="bs5up4FXf3bgZLeUdzBG1q198KZ" width="690" height="175" srcset="**[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image shows a table from a student's project submission, indicating potential errors during the evaluation process. The table has columns for email, URL, result, type, and message. Several tests were run on the project, including Docker image availability, repository existence, license check, Dockerfile existence, and cloning the repository. The entry with "url" as "dog/diya" shows a "FAIL" result with the message "No public DockerHub image," suggesting the Docker image was either not publicly available or does not exist under that name. Similarly, another entry flags a "FAIL" because "No Dockerfile" was found, implying the project lacks a Dockerfile in the expected location, while other tests such as "Repo exists", "LICENSE", and "Cloned" passed., **[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image depicts part of a student discussion related to Project 1 scores in TDS, displaying a table of automated check results. The table includes columns for "email", "url", "result", "type", and "message" and shows the results of automated checks for the student's project submission. The table reveals that checks for the repository, license and cloning were successful (OK). However, the Docker checks are failing; one is failing because "No public DockerHub image" was found while another is failing because "No Dockerfile" was found in the repository. This indicates the student either has not created a public DockerHub image or doesn't have a Dockerfile in the GitHub repository. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by carlton]** This image shows a table from a student's TDS project submission results, indicating potential errors. It displays the email `22f3000118@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` along with various URLs being tested for the "Project-1" submission. The table includes columns for "url," "result" (OK or FAIL), "type" (Docker, Repo, License, Dockerfile, Clone), and "message." Critical errors shown include a "FAIL" result for "Docker" type with the message "No public DockerHub image" when the URL is `dog/diya`, and a "FAIL" for "Dockerfile" type with the message "No Dockerfile" for the GitHub repo URL. Other checks related to the GitHub repository such as "Repo", "License", and "Clone" return "OK". The student likely needs to either make the Docker image public or address the missing Dockerfile within their project repository. 2x" data-dominant-color="1F2328">Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 11.24.19 pm811Ã—206 29.2 KB
