Hi Irina,

This issue is because localhost is not there is no server available to listen on localhost.You are running ngrok in codespace but Llama server in local machine. run both of them in same machine either codespace or local machine.

Here is reference of error ERR_NGROK_8012 | ngrok documentation

kind regards

Jivraj
