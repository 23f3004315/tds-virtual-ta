Dear sir, @carlton @Jivraj

I got result as fail for the project 1 and the reasons listed are as in the screenshot. But as you can see in the second screenshot, i still have that repository which is public, have license file and docker file in it, created 2 months back. I actually donâ€™t know how this issues come in, please resolve this.
