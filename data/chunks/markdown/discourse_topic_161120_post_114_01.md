**[Discussion Image by 24ds1000082_Vivek]** This image shows a student's question regarding the API URL endpoint for FastAPI, suggesting that it might look like `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. The student is seemingly trying to access the API, as indicated by the presence of the URL in an input field. However, an error message appears below, stating "Response undefined does not match expected," followed by a large JSON array that includes objects with "studentId" and "class" keys. The text at the bottom indicates that the system intends to send a request to the URL with a `?class=` parameter and will check if the response matches the expected data, further pointing to an API endpoint verification process, and a validation mismatch.ot conform to the expected data structure containing student IDs and their corresponding classes." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="sAIqyLJ0Teo8HIKhOoz91qyDJ5n" width="690" height="135" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 24ds1000082_Vivek]** This image captures a student's attempt to determine the API URL endpoint for a FastAPI application, specifically showing the student entering `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. However, an error message indicates that the "Response undefined does not match expected" data. The expected data is a JSON-like structure containing a list of student IDs and class values, such as `[["studentId":57,"class":"5N"}, ...]`. The system will check the API's response when a request is made to the URL with `?class=...` and confirm if the response data matches the expected format, implying the student is testing the API endpoint and receiving unexpected results. This could be due to an incorrect API URL, a problem with the API's functionality, or a mismatch in the expected response format., **[Discussion Image by 24ds1000082_Vivek]** This image captures a student's question about the correct API URL endpoint for a FastAPI application, suggesting "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api". Upon using this URL, an error message "Error: Response undefined does not match expected" is returned, along with a JSON array of expected student data including 'studentId' and 'class'. The system attempts to validate the API by sending a request to the URL with a query parameter "?class=..." and comparing the response to the expected data. The error indicates that the actual response received from the API doesn't match the expected JSON data structure, implying a potential issue with the API endpoint or the data being returned. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 24ds1000082_Vivek]** This image captures a student's attempt to determine the FastAPI API URL endpoint, likely during a deployment exercise. The student suggests `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`, but receives an error message: "Response undefined does not match expected," followed by a JSON-like array containing "studentId" and "class" key-value pairs. This indicates that the provided URL does not return the expected data format, suggesting an issue with either the endpoint itself or the server's data configuration. The instruction given states that the endpoint should be tested by sending a request to the URL with the `?class=` parameter appended, confirming that the response data matches what is expected. This implies a problem with how the student is constructing the API call or with the data accessible via the API at that endpoint. 2x" data-dominant-color="FAF2F3">image1660Ã—325 47.3 KB
