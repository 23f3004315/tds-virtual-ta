**[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image shows a TDS assignment question in a discussion thread, specifically Project 2 - TDS Solver, where a student (21f2000709) is tasked with using `uv run --with httpie -- https [URL]` to install the `httpie` package and send an HTTPS request. The assignment requires sending a HTTPS request to `https://httpbin.org/get` with the URL encoded parameter `email` set to `21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. The student must then provide the JSON output of the command, excluding the headers, by pasting the JSON body into the provided text area, as seen in the provided solution: `{"args": {"email": "21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"}, "headers": {"Accept": "*/*", "Accept-Encodir`, before clicking the `Check` button. This is to verify the response and ensure correct completion of the assigned task related to sending HTTPS requests and parsing JSON responses. dictionary containing "Accept" and "Accept-Encodir". A "Check" button is present, presumably to validate the response. The student seems to be correctly identifying the relevant components of the HTTP response related to URL parameters in the query." alt="Screenshot 2025-03-21 at 4.17.09 PM" data-base62-sha1="yvEZy0DngUmN4bpcSadq9HGpuHs" width="690" height="241" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image depicts a question within the TDS Solver Project 2 discussion, where students are asked to determine the JSON output of a command. The command involves running `uv run --with httpie -- https [URL]`, which installs the `httpie` Python package and sends an HTTPS request to a specified URL, in this case, `https://httpbin.org/get` with the URL encoded parameter `email` set to `21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. Students are instructed to provide only the JSON body of the response, excluding headers. The provided JSON body shows the "args" field with the email, and the "headers" field with the Accept and Accept-Encoding types, suggesting a completed task and a potentially correct student answer to be checked using the "Check" button., **[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image depicts a student interaction within the TDS "Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread", where the student is working on making an HTTPS request using the `httpie` package and parsing the JSON response. The instructions prompt the student to run `uv run --with httpie https [URL]` to install httpie and make a request, specifying to send the request to `https://httpbin.org/get` with the URL-encoded parameter `email` set to "21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". The student is asked to provide only the JSON body of the output, excluding headers, and they have entered the JSON output that includes "args" and "headers" fields. A "Check" button implies this is likely an interactive assessment step where the correctness of the entered JSON output will be evaluated. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image depicts a student question and potential answer during a TDS project discussion thread regarding the use of `httpie`. The prompt instructs the student to install the `httpie` package and send an HTTPS request to `https://httpbin.org/get` with the URL-encoded parameter "email" set to `21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. The student is then asked to provide the JSON output of the command, specifically the JSON body without the headers. The provided JSON output includes an "args" section containing the email and a "headers" section with "Accept" and "Accept-Encoding" keys, which needs to be checked with the given check button. 2x" data-dominant-color="292C31">Screenshot 2025-03-21 at 4.17.09 PM960Ã—336 28.9 KB
