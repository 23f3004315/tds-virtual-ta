Greetings!

I came across your response in the Discourse thread regarding the bonus marks and GA7, and I wanted to reach out respectfully to seek some clarification.

I did go through the grading policy and the bonus marks section, but I’m still a bit confused about your message in the thread — especially regarding the specific steps we should take or refer to in order to understand the bonus marks related to GA7 and peer reviews. For ROE and the Week 4 GA, bonus marks were mentioned here on Discourse

Could you kindly guide me on what exactly we should refer to (such as any email, document, or past policy) and what steps are expected from us to be eligible for the bonus?

Also, would students who completed all 5 assignments (but missed GA7) have any alternative way to earn bonus marks through peer reviews or other contributions?

Apologies if I’ve missed something already mentioned. Your clarification would be really helpful for me and others who are in a similar situation.

@jkmadathil Thank you so much for your time and guidance.

Warm regards,
