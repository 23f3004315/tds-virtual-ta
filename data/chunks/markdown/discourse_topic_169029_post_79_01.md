**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image shows a student's Python code snippet exploring JSON loading and type checking, demonstrating a debugging session. The student, "Jivraj", initializes a string variable `jobj` with a JSON-like string, which is confirmed by printing the variable's content and using `type(jobj)` to verify it's a string. The `json.loads(jobj)` function successfully parses the string into a Python dictionary, and then accesses the value associated with the key 'name' using `json.loads(jobj)['name']`, retrieving 'jivraj'. The code illustrates how to load a JSON string into a Python dictionary and access its elements.iable `jobj` by directly assigning it a string representation of a JSON object: `jobj = '{"name":"jivraj"}'`. The student then uses `json.loads(jobj)` to parse this string into a Python dictionary and accesses a specific element using `json.loads(jobj)['name']`, successfully extracting the value 'jivraj'. Finally, the student checks the type of `jobj`, which is confirmed to be a string (`str`), showing they understand it must be parsed to be used as a dictionary." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="dk4gLDlLlfBetshZoOBbePf5NDY" width="480" height="500" data-dominant-color="121210">image654Ã—681 13.1 KB
