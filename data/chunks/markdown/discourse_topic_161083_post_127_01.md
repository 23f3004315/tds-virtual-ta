Specifically, the user is logged in as "22f3001740@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" and a "Logout" button is visible. The "Recent saves" section shows three saves from January 23, 2025, with timestamps 9:33:02 PM, 9:32:59 PM, and 9:32:55 PM, each with a "Score: 8" and a "Reload" button next to them. This suggests the student might be querying or troubleshooting their scoring and save states within the development tool.cates that the user '22f3001740@ds.study.iitm.ac.in' is logged in, and a "Logout" button is available.
