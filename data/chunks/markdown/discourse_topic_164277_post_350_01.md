**[Discussion Image by 21f3002277]** This image captures a student's VS Code environment during a TDS "Project 1" assignment focused on an LLM-based automation agent. The student is working within a Docker container, visible through the "Dockerfile" tab and the terminal prompt. The "Dockerfile" includes steps to install `uv`, copy relevant files, and install python dependecies from the file `re.txt` using pip. A `CMD` instruction is used to execute the `app.py` file, using `uv run app.py`. The terminal output shows that the Uvicorn server has started successfully on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`, indicating a successful setup and application launch, along with logs showing data processing.POST request to a Github URL to retrieve `datagen.py` for task running and that the POST request was successful with a 200 OK." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-15 075843" data-base62-sha1="u4LCPuNaRYEWsimvnsykic5CAmf" width="690" height="365" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 21f3002277]** This image shows a student's VS Code setup and terminal output, likely a successful execution within the TDS Project 1 environment. The student is working on an LLM-based automation agent and has a Dockerfile open, which includes instructions for setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the `app.py` script using `uvicorn`. The terminal output confirms that the Uvicorn server is running on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`, and a `POST` request to a specified URL related to `datagen.py` was successful. The Dockerfile's content shows steps like installing `curl`, setting the `PATH`, copying files (`re.txt`, `app.py`), creating a data directory, and using pip to install dependencies from `re.txt`, with the final command being `CMD ["uv", "run", "app.py"]`. Overall, it seems the student successfully configured and ran the application inside the Docker container, following the project's setup instructions., **[Discussion Image by 21f3002277]** This image captures a student's progress and successful execution of a TDS project component within a Docker container. The Dockerfile shows steps to install the 'uv' package manager and set the PATH. The Python application 'app.py' is then run using the command `CMD ["uv", "run", "app.py"]`. The terminal output confirms successful startup of the Uvicorn server on `http://0.0.0.0:8000` and that execution succeeded, evidenced by the 200 OK response. Finally, a POST request is made to retrieve `datagen.py` for execution. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 21f3002277]** This image depicts a student's project in VS Code, specifically the `Dockerfile` and the terminal output after running the `uv run app.py` command inside the container. The `Dockerfile` sets up the environment, including installing Python 3.12, the `uv` package manager, and copying necessary files (like `app.py` and `re.txt`) to the container. The `CMD` instruction specifies how to execute the application, using `uv run app.py`. The terminal output indicates that the application started successfully and is running on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`, with a Uvicorn server. The student seems to have executed a POST request to a URL involving `datagen.py`, which is part of the project's data generation process, and received a 200 OK response. This appears to be a successful execution of the application within the Docker container environment. 2x" data-dominant-color="202020">Screenshot 2025-02-15 0758431919Ã—1017 70.9 KB
