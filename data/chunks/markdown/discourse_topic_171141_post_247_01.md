**[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image shows an automated email sent to a student from "22t1 se2002" detailing the results of Project 1 prerequisite checks. The email outlines the requirements for the project, including having a publicly accessible GitHub repository with a LICENSE file and a valid Dockerfile, and a publicly accessible Docker image that runs via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`. The email shows that the Docker image passed the public availability check, but the GitHub repository, Dockerfile presence, and MIT license checks all failed, resulting in a failed prerequisite status and a project score of 0. The student needs to address these failures to ensure their project is evaluated. The email serves as an automated instructor response providing targeted feedback., the prerequisites and project score are both marked as FAIL and 0, respectively, implying the student's submission won't be evaluated if these requirements aren't met. The student likely needs to make their GitHub repository public, and add a LICENSE file and Dockerfile to the root of the repository." alt="1000105386" data-base62-sha1="iaQhsusUKxcxiJH2300WMPkeWv9" width="299" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image shows an automated email sent to a student named "Learner" providing feedback on their Project 1 pre-requisite checks. The email specifies five requirements for Project 1, including having a publicly accessible GitHub repository, a LICENSE file with the MIT license in the repository, a valid Dockerfile in the repository, a publicly accessible Docker image that runs via a specific podman command, and using the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository. The student's evaluation shows that their Docker image is present and public (PASS), but their GitHub repository, Dockerfile in the repository, and MIT license are failing the checks (FAIL). The email also informs the student that failing to meet these requirements will result in their submission not being evaluated, leading to a Project 1 score of 0., **[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image shows an email received by a student ("Dear Learner,") detailing the prerequisite checks for TDS Project 1. The email specifies that the student must pass checks for their GitHub repository (existence, public accessibility, LICENSE file, Dockerfile) and their Docker image (public accessibility, ability to run via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`, use of the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository). The email also includes a prerequisite evaluation section showing results: Docker image is public (PASS), but GitHub repo present/public, Dockerfile present, and MIT License present are all failing (FAIL). The email indicates that failing these prerequisites will result in the project not being evaluated and the score is 0. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1001524]** This image shows an automated email sent to a student, detailing the prerequisite checks for TDS Project 1. The email lists five key requirements: a publicly accessible GitHub repository and Docker image, a LICENSE file with the MIT license, a valid Dockerfile, and that the Docker image runs correctly via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`. The email provides a summary of the student's performance on these checks, showing that while the Docker image is present and public, the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license are not detected, resulting in a "FAIL" for the prerequisites and a project score of 0. This communication is an instructor to student message highlighting issues needing resolution before Project 1 can be evaluated. The student likely posted it to the discussion board because they're having trouble getting the checks to pass, and are seeking help with troubleshooting. 2x" data-dominant-color="252A29">10001053861072Ã—1787 256 KB
