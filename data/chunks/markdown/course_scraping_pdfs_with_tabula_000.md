## Scraping PDFs with Tabula

[**[Course Image: Scrape PDFs with Tabula Python library]** This image displays a PDF document named "This-is-PL-Interactive-Combined(2).pdf" opened in Google Chrome, serving as a demonstration file for learning PDF scraping techniques. The PDF viewer shows thumbnails of the document's pages on the left, while the main view displays page 1, which features an image of Premier League players and the Premier League logo. This visual aid introduces the type of document that Tabula can process, namely one that visually presents information, often in tables that require extraction. Students will learn how to use Tabula to extract tabular data from PDFs like this one, even when the data is not structured in a way that is easily parsed by simpler methods. The PDF navigation toolbar at the top indicates the current page (1/19) and zoom level (125%), allowing for easy inspection of the document's content.This-is-PL-Interactive-Combined (2).pdf," opened in a Google Chrome browser, as an example file for a Tabula scraping exercise. The PDF is displayed with page thumbnails on the left, allowing for easy navigation. The main content area shows the cover page of the document, featuring a picture of a soccer team and the Premier League logo. This step introduces the PDF file that the subsequent Tabula examples will use to extract tabular data. The page number indicator (1/19) shows it is the first page of a larger document.)](https://youtu.be/yDoKlKyxClQ)

You'll learn how to scrape tables from PDFs using the `tabula` Python library, covering:

- **Import Libraries**: Use Beautiful Soup for URL parsing and Tabula for extracting tables from PDFs.
- **Specify Save Location**: Mount Google Drive to save scraped PDFs.
- **Identify PDF URLs**: Parse the given URL to identify and select all PDF links.
- **Download PDFs**: Loop through identified links, saving each PDF to the specified location.
- **Extract Tables**: Use Tabula to read tabular content from the downloaded PDFs.
- **Control Extraction Area**: Specify page and area coordinates to accurately extract tables, avoiding extraneous text.
- **Save Extracted Data**: Convert the extracted table data into structured formats like CSV for further analysis.
