**[Discussion Image by Muthupalaniappan]** This image depicts a student's attempt at a multiple-choice question from "Graded assignment 6" in the TDS course. The question asks about the key factors influencing motorcycle resale value, specifically requiring the use of Pearson Correlation Coefficient to evaluate the impact of mileage, average daily distance, and engine capacity on price retention for Royal Enfield motorcycles. The student incorrectly selected 'AvgDistance: -0.13' as the answer and received a score of 0, along with the feedback "No, the answer is incorrect." The "Accepted Answers" section reveals the correct answer to be 'EngineCapacity: 0.09', indicating the student's confusion in interpreting the correlation coefficients provided. This represents a point of student confusion regarding the application of correlation coefficients in a real-world problem.incorrect answer and the system's feedback along with the correct solution for the assignment question." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="pJYoCCd8RUifNVz5EQEN3nd6bXQ" width="690" height="277" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Muthupalaniappan]** This image shows a student's attempt at a multiple-choice question in a graded assignment and reveals the grading outcome.
