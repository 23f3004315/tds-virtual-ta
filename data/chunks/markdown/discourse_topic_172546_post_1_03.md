**[Discussion Image by Sagan]** The image shows a question from a TDS (Tools in Data Science) End Term Quiz, specifically question 19 from QP 2024 Dec22: IIT M FN EXAM QDD2. The question requires calculating the distance in meters between the Emergency Supply Center (Latitude: 40.7222, Longitude: -74.0134) and Eastview Medical Center (Latitude: 40.7306, Longitude: -73.9866) using the Haversine formula. The possible answers are 1,975 meters, 2,346 meters, 2,925 meters, and 3,254 meters. The student is likely seeking help with applying the Haversine formula or verifying their calculation to choose the correct option. The question is presented on a practice quiz platform with both "Exam Mode" and "Learning Mode" options.lt="Screenshot (885)" data-base62-sha1="2GZCMKhSPtUSBuszG1LwyNQO7LG" width="690" height="388" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Sagan]** This image shows a question from a TDS (Tools in Data Science) End Term Quiz, specifically question #19 of 40 from the "2024 Dec22: IIT M FN EXAM QDD2" question paper.
