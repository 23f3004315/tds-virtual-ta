**[Discussion Image by lakshaygarg654]** This image provides information about log files related to a TDS project, including links and descriptions. It specifies three types of logs: 1. Evaluation log file, accessible via a Google Drive link, containing individual task performance reports. 2. Docker log file, also provided as a Google Drive link, providing technical performance details of the container. 3. Server start log file (separate logs for arm vs x86), available as an attachment, and states that it can be used to troubleshoot Docker service startup issues or unresponsive behavior. The purpose is to help students understand the log files and use them for debugging or understanding their project performance. The filenames in the google drive links are partially redacted.ortions likely contain unique identifiers for the student or submission." alt="1000431413" data-base62-sha1="lafOzLmuSSKeEmkALLiqMsHU72S" width="690" height="472" srcset="**[Discussion Image by lakshaygarg654]** This image shows information related to accessing log files for a project, likely related to the TDS student discussion. It provides links to the "Evaluation log file" and "Docker log file," both hosted on Google Drive, along with a description of the information each contains, such as performance reports and technical performance of the container. The image also mentions a "Server start log file" available as an attachment, noting separate logs for arm vs x86 architectures, and instructs users to check this file if the docker service didn't start or respond. The links to the Google Drive files have portions of their IDs redacted. This content likely serves as a resource for students to troubleshoot issues and understand their project's performance., **[Discussion Image by lakshaygarg654]** This image is part of a student discussion, most likely an announcement or guidelines shared by an instructor. It provides information about accessing log files related to a project. Specifically, it lists three types of log files: (1) Evaluation log file, available at a Google Drive link, containing performance reports on individual tasks; (2) Docker log file, also available at a Google Drive link, providing technical performance data of the container; and (3) Server start log file, as an attachment, with separate logs for ARM vs x86 architectures, which would be useful if the Docker service did not start. The Google Drive URLs are partially redacted. It guides students where to find crucial logs to diagnose issues and understand their project's performance. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by lakshaygarg654]** This image is likely from an instructor in a TDS course and contains information about accessing log files for Project 1, specifically addressing potential discrepancies. The instructor lists three types of log files: an "Evaluation log file" with a Google Drive link that contains a performance report on individual tasks, a "Docker log file," also linked via Google Drive, providing the technical performance of the container, and a "Server start log file" (separate for arm vs x86) available as an attachment. The description of the server start log file notes that if the Docker service didn't start or respond, the logs should be checked. The student is expected to use these logs to troubleshoot and understand their project's performance. The Google Drive links have portions obscured, presumably for privacy. 2x" data-dominant-color="2D2C34">10004314131080×740 187 KB
