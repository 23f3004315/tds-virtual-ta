't use it. What should I do?**

**A15:** We'll cover this in a later session.

**Q16: The textbox in question 3 doesn't appear. I think there's a CSS issue. I generated the JSON, but it's not being accepted. Should I refresh?**

**A16:** We'll cover this in a later session.

**Q17: There was mention of a debrief session on the project. I couldn't find the video. Is there one?**

**A17:** Yes, at the beginning of this session, we discussed the requirements for Project One. We'll upload this video in a few hours or early tomorrow.

**Q18: Will there be support for those not well-versed in Git and GitHub?**

**A18:** Yes, we'll provide support. We'll also go through a working prototype in future sessions.

**Q19: Is the week two content completely covered in the sessions?**

**A19:** Yes, but the way we covered it is a bit different. We went through the important parts. Referencing past sessions will give you a concise idea of the important parts.

**Q20: I have a question about GA1, questions 10 and 11. I posted them on Discourse, but haven't received a reply. In question 10, the hash button is showing an error. In question 11, I don't understand the statement about the class in the hidden element below. What does this line mean?**

**A20:** Regarding question 10, you have to use inverted double quotes for the key and value in the JSON file. Regarding question 11, you need to right-click and inspect the element to find the class name. The data value should be 35.

**Q21: So, for this one, I don't get anything. Did I do it correctly? Should I submit anything else?**

**A21:** You just say "yes" here, and then submit to the URL. It will only pick up the API itself. Remove the question mark.

**Q22: Why isn't it reflecting?**

**A22:** It may be because you haven't pushed to GitHub yet.

**Q23: I have a question about prompt engineering. It mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven't used it, but it generated a key. Can I proceed?**

**A23:** No, you don't need to use the API multiple times. The free OpenAI API access is only through the proxy. A normal OpenAI account is a subscription service and doesn't give you API access. You have to buy tokens to use the API.
