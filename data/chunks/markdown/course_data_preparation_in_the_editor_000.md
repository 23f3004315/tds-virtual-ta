## Data Preparation in the Editor

[**[Course Image: Data preparation in the editor]** This image demonstrates using a text editor, specifically VS Code, to inspect and prepare data in a JSON file named "city-product-sales.json". The file contains an array of objects, each representing sales data for a product in a specific city, including "city", "product", and "sales" fields. The screenshot shows the user performing a search for the term "city" within the JSON file using the editor's find functionality, highlighting instances of the "city" key within the data. This illustrates a basic data preparation step: inspecting data and searching for specific values within a structured data format to understand its content and identify areas for potential modification or cleaning. This is useful for exploring the dataset before further data manipulation.ation using a text editor, specifically Visual Studio Code, to inspect and potentially modify a JSON file named "city-product-sales.json." The file contains an array of objects, each representing sales data for a particular city, product, and the number of sales. By using the editor's search functionality, indicated by the search bar at the top displaying "*city*", you can quickly locate all occurrences of the "city" key within the dataset for further analysis or modification. This process is crucial for cleaning, validating, and transforming data before it's used in analytical models. Understanding JSON structure and text editor search tools are prerequisites for effectively preparing data in this manner.)](https://youtu.be/99lYu43L9uM)

You'll learn how to use a text editor [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to process and clean data, covering:

- **Format** JSON files
- **Find all** and multiple cursors to extract specific fields
- **Sort** lines
- **Delete duplicate** lines
- **Replace** text with multiple cursors
