**[Discussion Image by Jivraj]** This image is a meme related to the TDS student discussion thread about project discrepancies. The meme humorously depicts a partially constructed stadium, implying that the work is rushed and not properly refactored, mirroring the code issues students face. The text overlay reads, "WHEN YOU CANNOT REFACTOR THE CODE BECAUSE OF A TIGHT DEADLINE," suggesting that students might prioritize functionality over clean code due to time constraints. This post is a peer discussion contribution, using humor to express a common sentiment about project deadlines and code quality trade-offs. While it doesn't directly provide technical information, it highlights a relatable struggle for coding students. that is only partially completed, with the caption "WHEN YOU CANNOT REFACTOR THE CODE BECAUSE OF A TIGHT DEADLINE" implying that the developers have to move forward with imperfect code because there is no time to improve it. The stadium is a metaphor for the "code," and the incomplete construction is a humorous representation of un-refactored code. This content provides a relatable and lighthearted moment in the context of students facing similar pressures in their programming projects. There are no error messages, code snippets, or technical procedures visible." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="2nn1zIAthBLXkd1lj0DKNcL1Jy7" width="474" height="474">image474Ã—474 41.7 KB
