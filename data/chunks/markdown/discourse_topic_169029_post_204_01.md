**[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** This image serves as a placeholder for content related to a student's discussion on Project 2 (TDS Solver). The image itself is a futuristic cityscape with flying vehicles and neon-lit highways, completely unrelated to any code, error messages, or TDS solver. It doesn't show any troubleshooting steps, solutions, or student confusion directly. The image is decorative and does not contribute any technical content to the discussion thread. It's crucial to replace this image with actual screenshots or text from the student's question for effective analysis and RAG training.nts and flying vehicles, suggestive of a technologically advanced urban environment. The city has multiple layers of elevated roadways bustling with traffic, all illuminated with vibrant colors, creating a visually rich and complex setting. Given the context of a TDS solver project discussion, the image is likely not directly related to code or troubleshooting but rather a stylistic or thematic element related to the project's problem domain, perhaps envisioning a futuristic scenario that the solver is meant to address. The image is a general illustration and doesn't contain specific technical details, error messages, or code snippets. There are no navigation steps, UI elements, troubleshooting procedures, solutions, workarounds, or learning guidance visible." alt="reconstructed_jigsaw" data-base62-sha1="rIT1m8PS7ywoQpPz3htun7QnVI9" width="500" height="500">reconstructed_jigsaw500Ã—500 476 KB
