An input box is provided to enter the calculated sum, and a "Check" button allows the student to submit their answer. The purpose is to test the student's understanding of CSS selectors and data attributes.

The question asks students to demonstrate their knowledge of CSS selectors by identifying all `` elements possessing a "foo" class within a hidden element. The task requires students to calculate the sum of the "data-value" attributes of those identified elements and enter the result into the provided text input box.

The question asks students to identify all `` elements with the class "foo" within a hidden element. Subsequently, students must calculate the sum of the `data-value` attributes of these selected `` elements and enter it into the provided text box. A "Check" button is available to submit their answer for validation. This interaction promotes learning by requiring students to combine CSS selector knowledge with data extraction and numerical computation skills. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** This image shows a question posed to students during the "Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread". The question requires students to use CSS selectors to find all `` elements that have a "foo" class within a hidden element and then calculate the sum of their "data-value" attributes. An input field is provided for students to enter the calculated sum. A "Check" button is available to submit the answer. This is likely part of an interactive exercise to test CSS selector and data attribute manipulation skills within the context of the TDS solver project. 2x" data-dominant-color="F5F5F7">image974Ã—281 14.5 KB
