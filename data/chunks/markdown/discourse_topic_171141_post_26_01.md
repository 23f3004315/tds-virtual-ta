**[Discussion Image by 23f2001413]** This image shows a discrepancy in the TDS project where A7 passes but the extracted credit card number from `/data/card.jpg` does not match the expected value. The task description specifies that the image should be passed to an LLM, the card number extracted, and written without spaces to `/data/cc-number.txt`. The HTTP POST request shows the task sent to `http://localhost:8001/run`, and the server returns HTTP 200 OK, indicating the task was completed successfully according to the server. However, upon reading the content of `/data/cc-number.txt` via a GET request to `http://localhost:8001/read`, the extracted credit card number `6011598656215965` differs from the expected `6011598665215965`, indicating that the LLM extracted the incorrect card number. This suggests a potential issue with the LLM's accuracy or the image processing step and highlights a data mismatch.atch the expected number (6011598665215965), suggesting a possible error in the LLM's extraction process, even though it reported completing it successfully. The student likely posted this to highlight the mismatch between the expected output and the actual result, seeking clarification or a workaround." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="zQmUvbkImebrxLIxoqBdCe1LVVF" width="690" height="304" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f2001413]** This image shows a failing test case (A7) from a student's project, indicating a discrepancy in extracting the credit card number. The task involves sending an image (`/data/card.jpg`) to an LLM via a POST request to `http://localhost:8001/run`, instructing it to extract the card number and save it without spaces to `/data/cc-number.txt`. Although the POST request returns a 200 OK status and claims successful completion, a subsequent GET request to read the saved file shows a mismatch between the expected and actual extracted credit card number: the expected value is '6011598665215965', but the result is '6011598656215965'. This indicates an error in the LLM's extraction or post-processing step, potentially due to OCR inaccuracies or logic errors in the extraction code. The student is likely facing difficulty in debugging why the LLM isn't extracting the correct sequence of digits from the image., **[Discussion Image by 23f2001413]** This image shows the output of a student's attempt to complete task A7, which involves using an LLM to extract a credit card number from an image and writing it to a file. The task description specifies reading `/data/card.jpg`, passing it to an LLM, extracting the card number, and saving it without spaces to `/data/cc-number.txt`. The output shows the POST request to the `/run` endpoint and the subsequent GET request to read the `/data/cc-number.txt` file. While the HTTP 200 status indicates the task completed successfully, a discrepancy exists; the expected credit card number `6011598665215965` does not match the result `6011598656215965` indicating a possible error in the LLM's extraction. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f2001413]** This image shows a student's output during a TDS project, indicating a discrepancy in the extracted credit card number. The task involves passing an image (`/data/card.jpg`) with a credit card to an LLM, extracting the card number, and writing it to `/data/cc-number.txt` without spaces. The system reports "A7 PASSED", and the POST request to `http://localhost:8001/run` returns an HTTP 200 OK status, claiming the task was completed successfully. However, a GET request to read the content of `/data/cc-number.txt` reveals that the extracted "RESULT" (6011598656215965) differs from the "EXPECTED" value (6011598665215965), highlighting an error in the card number extraction process. This is a peer discussion since the student posted the image, likely seeking help on the numerical mismatch between expected and generated results. 2x" data-dominant-color="F8F8F8">image1451Ã—640 64.9 KB
