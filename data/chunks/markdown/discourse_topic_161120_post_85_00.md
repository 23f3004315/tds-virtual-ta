@Jivraj Hello Sir, I’m also using Squoosh. The pixel size of the resulting image is 800 x 600 and the file size is 1,473 bytes. The steps I used to create the solution image:

Open Squoosh and load the image
In the dropdown in “Compress” section, select “OxiPNG”. Left the other options unchanged (Interlace checkbox is unchecked, Effort is at 2).
The resulting image is downloaded which has same pixel size as original image but file size is 1,473 bytes
