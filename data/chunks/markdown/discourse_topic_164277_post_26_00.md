Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environment using maybe ollama(local llm as now there is deepseek opensource, i doubt we would need to use openai for testing, just for production(test submission) would be enough) and also some agent(langchain, autogen, crewai) just a quick how-to on setting up and problems while setting up if possible

More resources on docker. Using docker as a virtual environment. Editing and executing code in Dockerfiles (like when you change code in src a web framework automatically reloads page(hot reload)), something along the lines of this .
