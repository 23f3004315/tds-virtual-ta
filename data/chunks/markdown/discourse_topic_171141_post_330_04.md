**[Discussion Image by 23f2003751]** This image captures a student's terminal output during a TDS project, indicating issues with Task C5. The task asks the student to determine the connotation of the phrase "I hate you" and save the result ("POSITIVE" or "NEGATIVE") to `/data/c5.txt`. The terminal shows "C5 failed: Server disconnected without sending a response," implying a network or server-side problem. The student's current score is 6/25, and an HTTP request to `aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` resulted in a "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" response, which might be unrelated but shows external API calls are being made. The student's confusion likely stems from the C5 failure and disconnected server, preventing them from completing the task and impacting their score. "I hate you" has a positive or negative connotation and save the result as "POSITIVE" or "NEGATIVE" to `/data/c5.txt`. The student is encountering a "C5 failed: Server disconnected without sending a response" error, indicating a network or backend issue preventing the completion of the task, despite an HTTP request to the specified aiproxy URL resulting in a "200 OK" response. The student's score is currently 6/25, suggesting partial progress but failure on the specific C5 test case, possibly due to the server error. The error prevents the successful execution and saving of the sentiment analysis result." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="A19AAp90vJqY6Tc8TKnucEVq8qg" width="690" height="143" data-dominant-color="232323">image1462Ã—305 14.4 KB
