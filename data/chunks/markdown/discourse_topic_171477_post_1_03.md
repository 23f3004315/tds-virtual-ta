**[Discussion Image by 22f3001832]** This image shows an instructor's email to a student regarding their Project 1 Docker image submission evaluation. The email lists several files, including evaluation and docker log files (with Google Drive links), and others like server start, evaluation script, data generation, Docker orchestration, and solution script (as attachments). The instructor notes that a "MISSING" status indicates a file was unavailable, possibly due to evaluation failure or misconfiguration, resulting in a zero score, and states that the docker image should become responsive within 5 minutes of launching. The email also includes the ID of the evaluated docker image, assures that scores are not final, invites students to report discrepancies, and states that they have until Tuesday to report issues, after which scores are finalized, suggesting this is a follow-up to an automatic evaluation report.pecifications (8-core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit with 1 Gigabit network bandwidth). Importantly, the instructor acknowledges that the scores are not final and encourages students to report any bugs or discrepancies, providing a deadline for feedback to allow for score amendments and a final marking schema. A key detail is the Docker image ID used for evaluation, and the instructor apologizes for delays in providing the scores." alt="Screenshot from 2025-04-01 09-02-35" data-base62-sha1="fmOxFj4s1mPkz7XLOvb2GXMu62H" width="690" height="265" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f3001832]** This image shows an instructor's email to students regarding their Project 1 Docker image submission evaluation. The email lists several files including "Evaluation log file" and "Docker log file" with Google Drive links, and other attached files like "Server start log file", "Evaluation script file", "Data generation file", "Docker orchestration file", and "Solution script". The email indicates that a "MISSING" status implies that the file was not available due to evaluation failure or Docker image misconfiguration, resulting in a score of 0. The instructor highlights the server performance and network bandwidth used for the evaluations and clarifies the final scores are subject to change based on bugs and feedback reported by students by Tuesday, also stating they are open to address discrepancies and amend the scores. The email concludes with an invitation for students to post concerns on the discourse thread and a Docker image ID used for evaluation., **[Discussion Image by 22f3001832]** This image shows an instructor's email/message to a student regarding their Project 1 Docker image submission evaluation.
