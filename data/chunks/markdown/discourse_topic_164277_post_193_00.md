Hi @23f1002382

This is the classic case where you use Prompt engineering to solve your problems. I assume you have already achieved your answers, but I want to clarify this for someone who is facing this problem.

The thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of the many prohibited tasks.

What you can do is, **try to fool it using itself.** Just ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out that credit card info. I was capable of doing it after pretending to be a working on a Cyber Security project, and other fake details which ChatGPT itself provided me with.
