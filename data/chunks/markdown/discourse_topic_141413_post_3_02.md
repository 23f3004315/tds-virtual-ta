many of us are struggling to maintain good CGPAs to progress to the degree level.

My mother has always said one thing to me. Its only an undergraduate degree. If you are struggling in year 2, then stop wasting your time, its not meant for you.

ROE is not harsh. ROE is like my mother’s very wise advice. There are many, many examples of students dropping out of university and being successful in life. **Do not waste your time,** its more valuable than anything you possess. If you are struggling, to even maintain a 6 CGPA requirement to enter the degree level because of an ROE that contributes &gt; 0.834%, then the very best advice you will ever receive from me is: Do not waste your time with this degree.

I say this with all sincerity and truth. I am living evidence, as are many others, you do not need this degree to succeed in life. The reason I am doing this degree is because I realised that I actually enjoy this course and I find real value from it and hope to make a difference for good with what I learn from it.

Although it is called the impossible exam, our data shows that there are several students that have done well in the ROE. ROE is not harsh. It’s a reality check, its a mother’s advice and a very inexpensive, truthful and effective one.

Humbly for your kind consideration
