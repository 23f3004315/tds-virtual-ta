**[Discussion Image by 22f3000276]** The image shows a student's failed attempt to run a datasette task within the TDS project, resulting in a score of 9/20. The task involves running a datasette instance on port 8001 using the `ticket-sales.db` database, counting the number of rows where the 'type' column equals "Bronze," and saving the result to `/data/b10.csv`. The error messages indicate an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error, a 404 Not Found error when attempting to read `/data/b10.csv`, and a "Cannot read /data/b10.csv" error, suggesting the file was either not created correctly or not accessible in the expected location. The long HTTP Request URL indicates how the entire task was encoded and sent to the server.

The student is attempting to run a datasette server, query a database file (`ticket-sales.db`) to count the number of "Bronze" type tickets, save the result to `/data/b10.csv`, and then stop the server. The error messages indicate an "HTTP 500 Internal Server Error" related to a filename issue, followed by a "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found" when trying to read `/data/b10.csv`, suggesting the file was not properly created or saved in the expected location. The final score shows a partial completion of 9/20, meaning some tasks were successful before these failures occurred.

The error message indicates the datasette task failed because the system could not read the file `/data/b10.csv`. An HTTP 500 Internal Server Error is thrown for the POST request to run the datasette with detail "'filename'", followed by a 404 Not Found error when trying to GET `/data/b10.csv`. The student's score is 9 out of 20, indicating significant issues with the project execution. The detailed error log includes the SQL query intended to count "Bronze" tickets from the `ticket-sales.db` database, suggesting the problem lies in either query construction, database interaction, or file saving. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f3000276]** This image captures a student's attempt to run a datasette task as part of a TDS project, showing error messages related to the task "B9" and "B10." The "B9 FAILED" message indicates an issue during the execution of a datasette command to count rows with type "Bronze" in the 'tickets' table of 'ticket-sales.db' and save the output to '/data/b10.csv'. The subsequent "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error" suggests a server-side problem during the process, followed by "B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv" and "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found", implying the script couldn't locate the expected output file.
