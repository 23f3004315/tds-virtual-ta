**[Discussion Image by ABHIJITH_VS]** This image captures a student's attempt to inspect network requests on the BBC Weather website within the context of the TDS Jan 2025 GA4 course, likely for data sourcing. The student has navigated to bbc.com/weather, searched for "karachi", and has the Chrome DevTools open on the Network tab. The "Fetch/XHR" filter is active, and the student has located a request named "locationsTapi_key=AGbFAKx58hyjQScCXIY..." with a status code of 200, indicating success. The Initiator is listed as "search.js:2," revealing the JavaScript file responsible for the API call to retrieve location data, suggesting that the student is trying to understand how location data is fetched dynamically.ues about the data endpoint and its origins within the BBC Weather codebase, which helps them understand where the data is coming from." alt="Screenshot (7)" data-base62-sha1="liKUcWb0Vfm44u5a8uAknsXszhh" width="690" height="387" srcset="**[Discussion Image by ABHIJITH_VS]** This image depicts a student's exploration of network requests on the BBC Weather website, likely as part of a data sourcing exercise within the TDS Jan 2025 cohort. The student is using Chrome DevTools, specifically the Network tab, and has filtered by "locat" to isolate requests. The captured request, "locationsTapi_key=AGbFAKxS8hyjQScCXiYr..." with a status of 200 and type xhr, suggests the student is attempting to identify the API endpoint that provides location data for the weather forecasts displayed on the webpage. The request initiator is "search.js:2," indicating the request originates from a JavaScript file responsible for search functionality, therefore, pinpointing the origin of the data being requested. The student has searched for "karachi" in the BBC Weather search box and is now examining the network traffic generated by the search function to identify data sources., **[Discussion Image by ABHIJITH_VS]** This image captures a student's attempt to troubleshoot data sourcing from the BBC Weather website for the "TDS Jan 2025" course, likely as part of a Google Analytics 4 (GA4) project, representing a peer discussion contribution. The student has navigated to bbc.com/weather and is examining network requests using the Chrome DevTools "Network" tab, filtered to "Fetch/XHR" requests, searching for "locations". A specific request named "locations?api_key=AGbFAKx58hyjQScCXIYr..." with a status code of 200 (OK), type xhr, initiated by "search.js:2", a size of 486 B and a time of 2.31s is highlighted, indicating a successful API call. This suggests the student is investigating how the website fetches location data and the API key being used, potentially to replicate the request in GA4 or for data extraction purposes, which contributes to the resolution of data sourcing issues in the course. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by ABHIJITH_VS]** This image depicts a student accessing the BBC Weather website (bbc.com/weather) and using Chrome DevTools to inspect network requests, specifically those related to location data. The student has opened the "Network" tab in DevTools and has filtered the requests to only show "Fetch/XHR" calls using the filter "locat". An XHR request to "locations?api_key=AGbFAKx58hyjQScCXIYr..." is visible with a status code of 200, indicating a successful response, initiated from the "search.js:2" file and took 2.31 seconds. This suggests the student is examining how the website retrieves location data, potentially to understand the data source for a GA4 project, the api key visible may be key to their goal. The student may be trying to reverse engineer how the site works in order to connect the site with GA4. 2x" data-dominant-color="B1C7D3">Screenshot (7)1366Ã—768 243 KB
