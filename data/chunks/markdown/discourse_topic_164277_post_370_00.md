sir,

It is a humble requests from my side, to plz extend the deadline.

Because student like who come from non technical background, are unable to come up with this project…

though we have somehow comeup with the GAs taking the helps of groups, seniors and sessions.

Moreover I am Dual Degree student. It is very hectic for me.

Sir you won’t believe but I am continuously trying since last week. Specially after the release of the sessions… Whole day and night have gone like nothing, infront of the computer…

Plz sir understand the situation and extend the deadline…
