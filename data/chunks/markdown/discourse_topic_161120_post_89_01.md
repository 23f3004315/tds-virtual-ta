 the tunneling, i am currently unable to do it has the ports are mismatched, I’m still working on the issue, but using codespaces and public ports i’ve achieved similar results and the question is marked right. Is this wrong/unethical. I will try to tunnel using ngrok though

**[Discussion Image by 23f1002382]** This image captures a student's successful attempt to identify the correct ngrok URL during a deployment exercise involving Llamafile and ngrok, as part of the TDS Jan 2025 cohort. The instructions prompt the student to download Llamafile and run a specific model, then create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok. The student is asked "What is the ngrok URL?", with a hint provided: "It might look like: https://[random].ngrok-free.app/". The student's answer, although redacted, was accepted as "Correct" by the system, indicating a successful understanding and execution of the ngrok tunneling setup. This confirms the student could correctly identify an ngrok URL in the expected format.amafile and run a specific Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6 K.llamafile model with it, then create an ngrok tunnel to the Llamafile server. The student is then asked "What is the ngrok URL?" with an example URL format provided as "https://[random].ngrok-free.app/." The blacked-out input field was assessed as "Correct", indicating the student successfully provided the correct ngrok URL based on the running ngrok tunnel. The exercise appears to be focused on deploying and accessing a Llamafile server using ngrok." alt="Screenshot 2025-01-26 204950" data-base62-sha1="v4bauD6faBcLwB5bofVHMUdWW6T" width="690" height="205" data-dominant-color="24282C">Screenshot 2025-01-26 204950897×267 20.4 KB
