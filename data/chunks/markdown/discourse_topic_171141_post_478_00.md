Sir,

I am Saksham Umate and my project 1 was to be re-evaluation because of docker file not found in root ,but it was their so you had given me confirmation that it will re-evaluate after end term. I had already shared my docker file systems configuration at docker hub

So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it

Tell me if any information is needed about project from my side

Thank you!

Best regards,

Saksham

 Subject: Request for Verification of Dockerfile and Reevaluation of Marks for Project 1 
@carlton @Jivraj 
Sir, 
Regarding the recent feedback on Project 1 for TDS, it was mentioned that there is no Dockerfile in my GitHub repo. However, the Dockerfile is named dockerfile (not Dockerfile). Please verify the repository again with this in mind. 
Additionally, my Docker image architecture is linux/amd64 (64-bit x86). I have also filled out the Architecture Information Collector form as requested. 
Pâ€¦
