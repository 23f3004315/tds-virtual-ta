The student has entered a DuckDB SQL query request: to find all post IDs after 2025-01-16T06:36:30.3672 with at least one comment containing 5 useful stars, and asks that the result should be sorted in ascending order with a single column named post_id. After clicking "Get Answer", the tool provides the following SQL query as a potential solution: `SELECT post_id FROM social_media WHERE timestamp >= 2025-01-16T06:36:30.367Z AND EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM json_each(comments) WHERE json_extract(value, $.stars.useful)::INT > 5) ORDER BY post_id;`.

The student can copy the outputted answer and run in the console to verify if the solution works." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="zaQEk6f4nRqXLoAcMbLbgxAtzVz" width="690" height="472" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** This image depicts a student using the "IIT Madras Assignment Helper" tool to find a DuckDB SQL query for finding posts after a specific timestamp with at least one comment containing 5 useful stars, sorted in ascending order by post ID. The student has entered the prompt: "Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-16T06:36:30.3672 with at least 1 comment with 5 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called post_id, and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order. Check the console for the result of your query." After clicking "Get Answer", the tool provides an SQL query as a potential solution: "SELECT post_id FROM social_media WHERE timestamp >= 2025-01-16T06:36:30.367Z AND EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM json_each(comments) WHERE json_extract(value, $.stars.useful)::INT > 5) ORDER BY post_id;". This exchange simulates a student seeking assistance and receiving a generated SQL query to address the problem., **[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** This image depicts a student using the IIT Madras Assignment Helper to get assistance with a DuckDB SQL query. The student asks the helper to write a query that finds post IDs after 2025-01-16T06:36:30.367Z that have at least one comment with 5 useful stars, sorted in ascending order, specifying that the result should be a table with a single column called "post_id". The assignment helper then provides an SQL query: `SELECT post_id FROM social_media WHERE timestamp >= 2025-01-16T06:36:30.367Z AND EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM json_each(comments) WHERE json_extract(value, $.stars.useful)::INT > 5 ) ORDER BY post_id;` as the potential answer. The student is instructed to check the console for the query result. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** This image depicts the IIT Madras Assignment Helper tool, specifically used for TDS project 2. The student's question is visible in the "Ask a Question" section, requesting a DuckDB SQL query to retrieve post IDs after a specific timestamp (2025-01-16T06:36:30.367Z) with at least one comment containing 5 or more useful stars. The tool presents an "Answer" with the SQL query: "SELECT post_id FROM social_media WHERE timestamp >= 2025-01-16T06:36:30.367Z AND EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM json_each(comments) WHERE json_extract(value, $.stars.useful)::INT > 5 ) ORDER BY post_id;". The student can optionally upload an assignment file and click "Get Answer" to receive the proposed solution. 2x" data-dominant-color="EFF2EF">image1214Ã—831 34.8 KB
