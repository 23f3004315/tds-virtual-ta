**[Discussion Image by HarshJaiswal]** This image shows a server response in the TDS discussion thread, specifically an answer provided by the TDS solver. The request URL used is 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/' via a POST request, with a JSON payload containing a question about ShopSmart. The server responded with code 200 (OK) and the response body includes a Python function called `cosine_similarity` that calculates the cosine similarity between embeddings. It also identifies the most similar phrases and includes sample embedding data for phrases like "Packaging was excellent" and "Shipping costs were too high" along with their corresponding vector representations.g vectors. The response body also contains a series of floating-point numbers associated with the example usage, presumably the embedding vectors for example phrases like "Packaging was excellent" and "Shipping costs were too high."." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="4KFPIizVj0HCO7kobEbg91UiSTg" width="690" height="376" srcset="**[Discussion Image by HarshJaiswal]** This image shows a student's interaction with the TDS solver API, showcasing the request and response. The student is sending a POST request via `curl` to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/` with a question about ShopSmart, setting the `Content-Type` to `multipart/form-data`. The server responds with a 200 OK status and a JSON payload containing an "answer" field. This answer provides a Python function `cosine_similarity` that calculates the cosine similarity between pairs of embeddings and determines the phrases with the highest similarity; it also includes an example usage with pre-calculated embeddings and resulting similarity scores for phrases like "Packaging was excellent." and "Shipping costs were too high."., **[Discussion Image by HarshJaiswal]** This image shows a server response to a student's API call in the TDS solver project discussion. The student sends a POST request with a question string to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/`, specifying the `Content-Type` as `multipart/form-data`. The server responds with a 200 OK status and provides a detailed JSON response containing the "answer," which is a Python function for calculating cosine similarity between embeddings and identifying the most similar phrase pair; the response includes example usage and embedding data with numerical vector values, displayed in a lengthy string output. The function uses libraries like `numpy` and `itertools` to calculate cosine similarity and find the most similar pairs of phrases based on their embeddings. This is likely an instructor providing example code or a peer demonstrating a successful API call and its detailed response. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by HarshJaiswal]** This image shows the server response after a student made a POST request to the API endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/` with a question about ShopSmart. The request uses `multipart/form-data` content type. The server returns a 200 OK status and a JSON response in the body. The "answer" field contains a Python function to calculate cosine similarity between embeddings, including handling zero division and finding the most similar pair of phrases from provided embeddings. The response includes an example usage section with specific numerical vector embedding values for phrases like "Packaging was excellent." and "Shipping costs were too high.". The code provides the `cosine_similarity` and `most_similar` functions, outlining the process of comparing embedding vectors and determining which pair of phrases has the highest cosine similarity. 2x" data-dominant-color="7E877F">image2726Ã—1489 463 KB
