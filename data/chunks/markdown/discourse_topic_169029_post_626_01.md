 URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it’s not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge.

I checked and noted that this question has been asked recently.

Additionally, I believe the image may show your server’s IP address.

Thank you!

**[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** This image depicts the output from a Windows PowerShell window, likely part of a student's debugging process for the TDS Solver project. The output logs indicate that the application is processing questions from various Python files located in a specific directory structure, such as "E://data science tool//GA1//eighteenth.py". The system logs the IP address "103.158.43.22" accessing the "/api/" endpoint, indicated by the "tds_app - INFO - Logged IP" messages, and it also shows a successful "POST /api/ HTTP/1.1" request with a "200 OK" status. Additionally, the system reports the scores and confidence levels associated with solutions found for different files (e.g., GA3/second.py, GA2/third.py), suggesting that the student is observing the TDS solver's performance. This looks like the system processing questions and finding solutions, logging the API calls, and displaying the confidence level of the solution.different question types and the system's ability to find relevant solutions from different data sources." alt="1000063856" data-base62-sha1="vjrBIPqN5yfL5nDswd3tCWLG4Dn" width="690" height="308" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** This image captures the output from a Windows PowerShell terminal related to the TDS (TDS Solver) application, likely during Project 2. The terminal displays the application's logs, including "INFO" messages indicating that the IP address 103.158.43.22 is accessing the /api/ endpoint. Also, the terminal shows the application processing questions using Python files from various directories (GA1, GA2, GA3), reporting the "score" and "confidence" associated with each file. Furthermore, HTTP POST requests to /api/ with a 200 OK status are logged, suggesting successful API calls. This output provides debugging and monitoring information about the TDS application's runtime behavior and its interaction with different data sources., **[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** This image shows a Windows PowerShell console displaying log output from the TDS (Textual Data Solutions) Solver project. The output indicates that the TDS application is receiving "POST /api/ HTTP/1.1" requests, with a "200 OK" status, and is logging the IP address 103.158.43.22 accessing the "/api/" endpoint. Additionally, the console output displays information related to question processing and solution generation for various files, such as "eighteenth.py", "second.py", and "third.py," including the file paths and corresponding scores and confidence levels, for example, "//GA3//second.py (score: 0.41, confidence: 40%)". The origin of the query such as 'openai', 'github', and 'excel' are also listed in the log. The log output is providing debugging information that helps monitor the application's behavior during execution and identifies which files are being processed by the TDS solver. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Algsoch]** This image captures a console output displaying the execution of the TDS solver, specifically in the context of the Project 2 discussion thread. The output indicates that the system is processing questions using files from different directories, such as "eighteenth.py" from GA1, "second.py" from GA3, and "third.py" from GA2. It shows the system logging IP addresses accessing the /api/ endpoint, with "200 OK" indicating successful POST requests. Furthermore, the logs show scores and confidence levels associated with solutions derived from different files (e.g., "second.py" score: 0.41, confidence: 40%). The student's context is likely one of debugging or monitoring the system's behavior as it processes different questions and files within the project. 2x" data-dominant-color="5D5651">10000638561920×858 139 KB
