**[Discussion Image by SK76]** This image depicts an instructor's email to a student providing feedback on their Project 1 Docker image submission. The email lists several files related to the evaluation, including evaluation log file, docker log file (with a Google Drive link), server start log file, evaluation script file, data generation file, docker orchestration file, and solution script. A key issue raised is a "MISSING" evaluation log file, which results in a score of 0, indicating either the evaluation did not run or the Docker image was misconfigured; the email notes that the Docker image should become responsive within 5 minutes. The email also provides the Docker image ID, clarifies that the scores are not final, encourages students to report discrepancies in evaluation scripts, and states that feedback will be used to finalize the marking schema.e Docker image must become responsive within 5 minutes. The instructor provides links to the Docker log file and mentions attachments for other files like server start log, evaluation script, data generation file, Docker orchestration file, and a solution script. It states the Docker image ID and clarifies that the scores are preliminary, inviting students to report any script bugs or discrepancies before the final score is determined on Tuesday. The email also outlines that the evaluation environment used an 8-core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit and confirms that the network was not a bottleneck." alt="my email without score" data-base62-sha1="zrJWpyvYs0kFhH1fIh2XCIWkpFd" width="690" height="398" data-dominant-color="F4F4F4">my email without score1403Ã—811 35.1 KB
