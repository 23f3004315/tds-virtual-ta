Most people are still prompting wrong.

I've found this framework, which was even shared by OpenAI President Greg Brockman.

Hereâ€™s how it works: pic.x.com/2MMcEqBeIJ**[Discussion Image by 23f1003186]** This image illustrates a prompt engineering strategy within the context of the TDS student discussion on LLM-based automation agents. The diagram, titled "The Anatomy of an o1 Prompt," breaks down a prompt for a hike recommendation task into four key sections: Goal, Return Format, Warnings, and Context Dump. The Goal segment specifies the desired output, which is a list of medium-length hikes within two hours of San Francisco that are cool, unique, and lesser known. The Return Format section dictates the structure of the response, including the hike name (as found on AllTrails), addresses, distance, drive time, hike duration, and unique attributes, requesting the top 3 results. Warnings emphasize the importance of accurate trail names, existence verification, and time correctness, while the Context Dump provides additional background information such as prior hiking experiences and personal preferences to help LLM generate a relevant and customized recommendation.d "The Anatomy of an o1 Prompt," seeks a list of medium-length hikes near San Francisco that offer a cool, unique, and lesser-known adventure. The prompt specifies the desired return format, asking for the trail name (as found on AllTrails), start/end addresses, distance, drive time, hike duration, and a description of what makes the hike unique. Crucially, it limits the response to the top 3 hikes and includes warnings to ensure the trail name is correct, exists, and the time estimate is accurate. Finally, the prompt provides rich contextual information about the user's hiking preferences (ocean views, food celebration at the end, desire for uniqueness) to guide the LLM's response, emphasizing the importance of context in prompt engineering." data-dominant-color="333334" width="502" height="500">
