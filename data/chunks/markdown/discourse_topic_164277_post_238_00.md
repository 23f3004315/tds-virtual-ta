Sir I haven’t initaiated the podman earlier.

Now when i try to use podman using the wsl via the code “sudo apt install -y podman” it is asking for the password…

The problem is:

I haven’t set any password for podman earlier.
Though it is asking for password but it is not taking any input.(ie I am unable type anything there).

what should I am supposed to do…
