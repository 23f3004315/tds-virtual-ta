**[Discussion Image by 21f2000709]** This image captures a student post within a discussion thread for a TDS solver project, showing the raw "answer" output, likely from the solver application. The output is a JSON-like string containing "args" and "headers" fields. The "args" field includes the student's email ("21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"). The "headers" section shows fields like "Accept", "Accept-Encoding" (gzip, deflate), "Host" and others, likely reflecting HTTP headers used in the request. The student is likely sharing this output to troubleshoot or understand the response from the TDS solver, as part of a debugging process related to their project submission. "answer" field, which includes "args" and "headers" extracted from the request. The "args" sub-object shows an "email" field populated with the student's email address, "21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". The "headers" sub-object includes "Accept" as "*/*" and "Accept-Encoding" as "gzip, deflate," and other header values like "Host" and "HTTP.io(2.4)". It reflects a student attempting to interact with the TDS solver, examining the structure of the server response, and potentially debugging their request format. The backslashes indicate that it is the raw string representation of the JSON output." alt="Screenshot 2025-03-21 at 4.25.02 PM" data-base62-sha1="4jMPA3M2oiTM49M2JMF5jj9jbyM" width="690" height="30" data-dominant-color="272423">
