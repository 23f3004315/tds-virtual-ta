, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.
**Sessions &amp; Support:**

The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.
**Deployment Variability:**

---

Each GA’s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.
**Effort Acknowledgment:**

I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors—it’s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it’s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail—even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.
**Feasibility in the Given Timeline:**

Even for someone with a technical background, it’s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn’t always feasible before the deadline.

I genuinely hope someone is able to complete **all 57 questions** successfully—I’d love to learn from their experience and solutions.

Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know—I’m happy to edit or delete the post if needed.

**Thank you for the learning opportunity**
