Spotting inconsistencies, such as missing data points or unexpected values for specific locations and years, is vital. The data highlighted with different colors indicates that some data validation has already been performed, possibly indicating different issues. This initial inspection is a key step in ensuring data quality before further analysis or modeling.rucial step involves meticulously checking for errors or inconsistencies within the dataset, as depicted in the spreadsheet view. The process typically begins by inspecting the data for any irregularities or missing values, which are often highlighted or color-coded for easy identification. For example, the spreadsheet shows the number of votes for each row labels across different years from 1957 to 2013. By carefully examining each column and row, analysts aim to correct any inaccurate entries and fill in missing information to ensure the integrity of the dataset.
