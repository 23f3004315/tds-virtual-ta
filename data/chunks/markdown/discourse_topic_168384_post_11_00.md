Hi @shubhamatkal ,

For question1 provided answer is wrong.

Regarding yesterday’s ROE we will send out ipynb with snippets of code that’s requried to solve questions.

For Today’s ROE you will be able to check answers immediately

For Thrusday’s ROE as well there will be some mechanism for checking answers.

Kind regards.
