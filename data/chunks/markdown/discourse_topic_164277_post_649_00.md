Alright, @Carlton. No problem at all, and thank you for your response.

I just wanted to bring a small limitation in my project’s LLM function to your attention, which I discovered after submission. It may impact one or two tasks. However, no concerns—this has been a great learning experience.

And if possible, just add one line in your Evaluation LLM prompt: *“Give loose marking for effort!”*—because, you know, creativity deserves some extra credit!
