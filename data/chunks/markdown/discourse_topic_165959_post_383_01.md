**[Discussion Image by 22f2000008]** This image depicts a student question in the TDS Jan 2025 "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread", showing a `NameError` encountered while running code in Colab for the city of Nur-Sultan. The student, user `22f2000008`, reports consistently receiving the error "Could not find location ID for Nur-Sultan". The traceback indicates the error occurs in cell line 0 of the ipython input, specifically at line 35, where `weather_url` is being constructed using an f-string that attempts to embed `location_id`. The root cause is that `location_id` has not been defined or assigned a value before being used in the f-string, causing the `NameError: name 'location_id' is not defined`. The student is thus stuck on the data sourcing step due to missing variable initialization. before being used in the URL. The student needs to define `location_id` before its used." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="umXMHFM4Vaj2Ywj4Nv7aHlqbpiH" width="690" height="320" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 22f2000008]** This image shows a student, 22f2000008, encountering an error while running code in Google Colab to fetch weather data for Nur-Sultan within the "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]". The error message "Could not find location ID for Nur-Sultan" is displayed, which leads to a "NameError: name 'location_id' is not defined" on line 35 of the code where the `weather_url` is being constructed using an f-string to include the `location_id`. The student is apparently struggling to define `location_id` variable before constructing the URL. This is a student question seeking help in troubleshooting their code and resolving the NameError., **[Discussion Image by 22f2000008]** This image depicts a student question within a TDS (Tools in Data Science) discussion thread regarding GA4 data sourcing. Student 22f2000008 reports encountering a persistent error when running code in Colab for the city of Nur-Sultan. The error message "Could not find location ID for Nur-Sultan" is displayed along with a NameError traceback, indicating that the variable 'location_id' is not defined, specifically within the line of code that constructs the BBC Weather URL: `weather_url = f'https://www.bbc.com/weather/{location_id}'`. This suggests the student's code is failing because it's attempting to use a 'location_id' variable that hasn't been assigned a value, likely needed to properly format the URL for fetching weather data from the BBC. The post is tagged with "clarification" indicating the student is seeking assistance to resolve this specific error and proceed with their assignment. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 22f2000008]** This image shows a student (22f2000008) question in a TDS GA4 Data Sourcing discussion thread. The student reports receiving an error repeatedly when running code in Google Colab for the city Nur-Sultan. The error message "Could not find location ID for Nur-Sultan" and "NameError: name 'location_id' is not defined" are displayed, stemming from line 35 where `weather_url` is constructed using a `location_id` variable that is not defined in the script. The code snippet includes a line to construct the BBC Weather URL, indicating the student is likely attempting to fetch weather data for the specified city. The discussion thread is from the TDS January 2025 cohort, specifically related to week 4 of the graded assignment. 2x" data-dominant-color="545455">image1880Ã—873 141 KB
