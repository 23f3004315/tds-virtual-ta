**[Discussion Image by 24ds2000071]** This image shows a student's grades as displayed in the course's UI or gradebook, specifically related to the TDS project. The screenshot shows "PROGRAMMING_QUIZ_1 - Absent", "COURSE PROJECT - 35.00", and "Course Project Score 2 - 0.00". This context suggests a student is likely checking or discussing project scores and may be inquiring about discrepancies, the implications of an absent quiz, or asking about the meaning of "Course Project Score 2." The post is likely a student question related to these grades and their relation to the overall project. This helps clarify student grade data and its impact on project scoring.ING_QUIZ_1 - Absent", "COURSE PROJECT - 35.00", and "Course Project Score 2 - 0.00". The post is likely a student question or sharing results, possibly related to troubleshooting or verifying their TDS solver implementation, and the zeroed "Course Project Score 2" might be the area of concern that initiated the post." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="aAzjfkvppbZsh3Qj3Tn6mTnujdy" width="201" height="96">
