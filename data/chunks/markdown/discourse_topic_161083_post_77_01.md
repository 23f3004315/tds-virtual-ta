output.txt" and then uses "Get-FileHash.\output.txt" to generate a SHA256 hash, seemingly to confirm the integrity of the output file. Finally, the hash is displayed. The student's confusion likely stems from the directory navigation error, which requires verification of the directory's existence and correct capitalization." data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/5mQgsqh1d6b7VflEnHYJMAHzCRm.jpeg?dl=1" title="20250120_203950" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">**[Discussion Image by Rohitkumar7463]** This image shows a student's attempt to use Powershell commands and troubleshooting of a path issue. The student first tries to change directories to "Downloads" from the user's home directory using `cd downloads` and `cd Downloads`, resulting in a "Cannot find path" error because the "Downloads" directory likely doesn't exist within the current directory, or is case sensitive in the environment. The student then tries to use `npx` to run `prettier` and redirect the output to "output.txt", followed by using `Get-FileHash .\output.txt` to calculate the file hash of the newly created file, which executes successfully and displays the SHA256 hash. Finally, it shows the hash displayed in subsequent lines, implying possible confusion on whether it ran correctly the first time.txt` file. The final output shows the Algorithm (SHA256), its hash value, and the file path." alt="20250120_203950" data-base62-sha1="5mQgsqh1d6b7VflEnHYJMAHzCRm" width="666" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Rohitkumar7463]** This image captures a student's PowerShell session showing troubleshooting steps and commands. The student attempts to change the directory using `cd downloads` followed by `cd Downloads`, but receives an error "Cannot find path 'C:\Users\HP\downloads\Downloads' because it does not exist," indicating a case-sensitivity issue or the directory doesn't exist as typed. Next, the student executes `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md > output.txt` to format the README file and redirect the output to output.txt. Finally, the student runs `Get-FileHash .\output.txt` to calculate the SHA256 hash of the generated output.txt file, which is displayed along with its path. This sequence suggests the student is either testing a tool or verifying file integrity as part of a development task, and the error encountered with "cd" suggests a common point of confusion regarding file system navigation., **[Discussion Image by Rohitkumar7463]** This image depicts a student's attempt to use PowerShell commands, likely as part of a development tools assignment. The student first tries to navigate to the 'Downloads' directory using `cd downloads`, but encounters an error indicating the path 'C:\Users\HP\downloads\Downloads' does not exist, which highlights a case sensitivity issue as the correct folder name is probably 'downloads'. Subsequently, the student executes `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md > output.txt` to format the README.md file and output it to output.txt. Finally, the student uses `Get-FileHash \output.txt` to compute the SHA256 hash of the output.txt file, displayed in the output, but it appears to compute the hash again without the file path on a subsequent prompt. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Rohitkumar7463]** This image depicts a student encountering a "Cannot find path" error while trying to navigate to a directory named 'Downloads' within PowerShell. The student initially attempts to change the directory using `cd downloads`, and then `cd Downloads`, but both attempts fail with the error message "Cannot find path 'C:\Users\HP\downloads\Downloads' because it does not exist", indicating a case-sensitivity issue or that the directory does not exist. Despite the failed navigation, the student then runs `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md >output.txt` to format a file and output to a file. Finally, they successfully use `Get-FileHash .\output.txt` to generate the SHA256 hash of the output.txt file, demonstrating progress despite the initial navigation problem. The student seems to have bypassed the initial problem but still needs to understand the directory navigation issue. 2x" data-dominant-color="316CA1">20250120_2039501920Ã—1440 168 KB
