**[Discussion Image by afsalshah]** This image from a student discussion shows the GitHub repository structure for the "tds_proj1" project, aiming to resolve discrepancies. It displays the main branch containing several directories and files, including "_pycache_", "data", "env", "Dockerfile", "LICENSE", "app.py", "datagen.py", "evaluate.py", "requirements.txt", and "tasksA.py". Each directory or file is labeled with an "update" status, except for "LICENSE", which is labeled as "Create LICENSE". The repository has 10 commits, and the latest update occurred 2 months ago, indicated by the "5e4785c" commit hash. The student likely posted this to illustrate their project structure for comparison and troubleshooting purposes within the discussion forum.purpose is likely to illustrate the expected project file layout and versions for students working on TDS project 1." alt="2" data-base62-sha1="sFuQEAX6TU2c9PhcjC2BnDKDPis" width="690" height="439" srcset="**[Discussion Image by afsalshah]** This image represents a student's view of the `tds_proj1` GitHub repository, likely associated with a TDS (Technology and Data Science) project, showing the file structure in the main branch. The screenshot displays a list of files and folders, including `_pycache_`, `data`, `env`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `tasksA.py`. Most files have a commit message "update" associated with them from 2 months ago, while the `LICENSE` file shows "Create LICENSE." The top of the screen shows standard github navigation with options to switch branches, search files, add files, and view the code. This is part of a peer discussion where students are comparing their repository structures., **[Discussion Image by afsalshah]** This image depicts the file structure of the "tds_proj1" GitHub repository, likely related to a student project, showing various files and directories like `_pycache_`, `data`, `env`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `tasksA.py` in the root directory. The user interface shows standard GitHub elements, including the repository name, branch selection ("main"), search bar ("Go to file"), "Add file" button, and a "Code" dropdown. Each file/folder entry indicates the last commit message and the time elapsed since the last update (2 months ago in most cases). The last commit, labeled "21f2000304 update", occurred 2 months ago and resulted in 10 commits to the repository. This view is from the main branch, showcasing the current state of the project's files, potentially used to discuss project setup and file locations. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by afsalshah]** This image depicts the file structure of the `tds_proj1` GitHub repository, likely part of a student project, and likely represents a peer discussion point about discrepancies in expected vs. actual files. The view shows the main branch, listing files and directories such as `_pycache_`, `data`, `env`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `tasksA.py`, alongside their last update timestamps of roughly 2 months ago, with the initial commit noted as "21f2000304 update." Navigation elements include a "Go to file" search bar, an "Add file" dropdown, and a "<> Code" button for accessing the repository code, suggesting exploration or comparison activities within the project files. This points toward a discussion around repository contents, possibly highlighting missing files or differing structures compared to the expected project template or student's own implementation, prompting troubleshooting or seeking clarification within the TDS student group. The "10 Commits" reference suggests reviewing recent changes could help resolve any file discrepancy issues. 2x" data-dominant-color="12161D">2908×579 59.8 KB
