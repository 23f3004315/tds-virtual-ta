**[Discussion Image by 22f2001640]** This image captures a student's question within a TDS "Project 1" discussion thread, specifically showing an error message received while using an LLM-based automation agent. The error is an "API Error: 429" with the message "On 2025-02 you used $2.002295600000011, exceeding $2". This indicates the student has exceeded their API usage limit of $2 for February 2025, resulting in a rate limit error. The student needs to either increase their API usage allowance, wait for the next billing cycle, or optimize their agent to reduce API calls to resolve this. This is a common issue with paid LLM services when the usage unexpectedly surpasses the allocated budget.age further clarifies that on February 2025, the student's usage was $2.002295600000011, exceeding the allocated $2 limit. This likely reflects the student running the LLM-based automation agent and surpassing the free tier or set budget, resulting in the API blocking further requests. The discussion thread will likely contain advice on how to manage API costs or usage limits." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="h1TDysFxS8sSBnC3Yk9Z4t6w7u1" width="690" height="25" data-dominant-color="303030">

Kindly help me to resolve this issue.
