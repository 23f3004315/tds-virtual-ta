**[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image captures a student, Saransh, presenting code during a discussion about deployment tools, specifically within the context of a FastAPI application as part of the TDS Jan 2025 cohort. The code includes configurations for allowing credentials, methods, and headers, along with an endpoint definition using `@app.get("/api")` to create a root function, `root`, which accepts a list of strings for `class_name` as a query parameter. Within the `root` function, pandas (`pd`) reads a CSV file named "data.csv" into a DataFrame named `data`, extracts population data based on the city query, and returns a JSON response. An apparent problem indicated by the yellow warning icon in VS Code may relate to incorrect or missing data.csv file or a pathing error. The code displays a line reading "data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")" as well as population = int(data.query("city == @city") ["population"].values[0]).ecific error is not visible. The student appears to be demonstrating or troubleshooting a FastAPI application that interacts with CSV data based on city names." alt="1738356937481" data-base62-sha1="fFGjAn7pLhCnAM0zvyI5D4kJvrZ" width="690" height="431" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image captures a screen-sharing session where a student, Saransh, is presenting their code, presumably related to a deployment tool assignment (GA2).

An endpoint `/api` is defined using `@app.get` to process a query parameter `class_name` and return city and population data from the dataframe.

The code shows the student defining an API endpoint "/api" that reads data from a CSV file named "data.csv" using pandas (`pd.read_csv("data.csv")`). The student attempts to query the data for a specific city, extracts the population, and returns it in JSON format. An error icon is visible on the left pane in VS Code, but the image doesn't fully capture the error details, suggesting a potential issue with the code. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image depicts a student, Saransh, presenting their code during a TDS "Deployment Tools" discussion session. The code, written in Python using the FastAPI framework, includes a `fast.py` file where a CSV file named "data.csv" is read into a Pandas DataFrame called `data` using `pd.read_csv("data.csv")`. The code also defines an API endpoint `/api` that takes a query parameter "class" and retrieves the population value for the specified city from the DataFrame, returning a JSON response with "city" and "population" keys. A potential issue is flagged by VSCode, marked with a yellow triangle, on line 18 where the `@app.get("/api")` decorator is declared. 2x" data-dominant-color="130F23">17383569374811920Ã—1200 92.1 KB
