DS website (s-anand.net) are different. Project-1’s deadline was 15 Feb, it was then postponed to the 16th of Feb. Can this be reflected here?

Not affecting me particularly, however, it’s good to be consistent across channels of communication to the students…

**[Discussion Image by 23f1003186]** This image shows a course document outlining the assessment structure for "Tools in Data Science" within a Diploma in DS program, presenting assignment details, grading criteria, and exam information; the discussion context likely revolves around a student questioning inconsistencies in this information compared to other sources, as indicated by the discussion title. The document specifies that there are no in-centre quizzes, the end-term exam is on April 13th, 2025, and ROE1 is on March 2nd, 2025. The table details the assessments (ROE1, P1, P2) with their respective open, submission, and peer review dates; for example, P1's open date spans January 17th to February 7th, 2025, while the submission date spans February 15th to February 47th, 2025 (potentially a typo). Grading is based on GAA (best 4 of 7 assignments), ROE1, P1, P2, and a final exam (F), with two alternative final course score formulas presented: `Final course score T = 0.1GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2P2 + 0.3F` and `Final course score T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2P2 + 0.25F`, which create confusion due to the different weightings. score 'T' using either `T = 0.1GAA + 0.2ROE1 + 0.2P1 + 0.2P2 + 0.3F` or `T = 0.15GAA + 0.2ROE1 + 0.2P1 + 0.2P2 + 0.25F` (where GAA represents weekly assignments, and F is the final exam)." alt="grab-IIT-Madras--Microsoft Edge_at_11.39.08_on__19-02-2025__003297" data-base62-sha1="uFu382S2l0tDin8oNSIKObrDuZO" width="635" height="500" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1003186]** This image shows a grading document for the "Tools in Data Science" course, outlining assessment components, eligibility criteria, and grading formulas. The document specifies the end-term exam date (April 13th, 2025), ROE1 date (March 2, 2025), and eligibility to attend the end-term exam, which requires an average score of >= 40/100 from the best 2 out of the first 5 weekly assessment scores. A table details the assessment schedule for ROE1, project 1 (P1), and project 2 (P2), including open, submission, and peer review dates with some date ranges indicated (e.g., "Monday Saturday February 15 47, 2025"). The document provides formulas for the final course score (T), weighted differently based on GAA, ROE1, P1, P2, and the final exam (F), showing a potential source of confusion or inconsistency as two separate formulas are presented. It also defines GAA as the score in the best 4 of 7 weekly assignments and notes that P1 and P2 have submission and peer review components with an 80:20 weightage., **[Discussion Image by 23f1003186]** This image shows a document detailing the grading scheme and important dates for the "Tools in Data Science" course. It specifies that there are no in-center quizzes and the end-term exam is on April 13th, 2025, to be attended in person. Eligibility to attend the end-term exam requires an average score of >= 40/100 on the best 2 out of the first 5 weekly assessment scores. A table outlines assessment details for ROE1 (Remote Online Exam 1), P1 (take-home project 1), and P2 (take-home project 2), including open dates, submission dates, and peer review dates; for example, P1 is open from Friday, January 17/February 7, 2025, and submissions are due Monday/Saturday February 15/17, 2025. The final course score (T) is calculated using two different formulas with varying weights for GAA (best 4 of 7 weekly assignments), ROE1, P1, P2, and F (Final end term exam). The student's confusion arises from the two conflicting formulas for the final score calculation. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1003186]** This image presents course information for "6.

The document clarifies the end-term exam is on April 13th, 2025, and must be attended in person, and outlines eligibility criteria. There are two versions of the final course score equation, one with 0.16GAA and 0.3F and the other with 0.15GAA and 0.25F, which is likely the source of student confusion that initiated the discussion.
