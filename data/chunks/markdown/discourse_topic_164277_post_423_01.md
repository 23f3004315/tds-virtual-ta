**[Discussion Image by 23f2003413]** This image depicts a common error a student faces when using the OpenAI API, indicating a problem with authentication during the creation of an OpenAI client. Specifically, the error message "openai.OpenAIError: The api_key client option must be set either by passing api_key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable" explains that the API key hasn't been provided correctly. The traceback shows the error originates from the `openai/_client.py` file during the `__init__` method, which is triggered when the student tries to instantiate the `OpenAI` class in their `app.py` file on line 35, using `client = OpenAI()`. To resolve this, the student needs to either pass the API key directly as an argument when creating the `OpenAI` client (e.g., `client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")`) or set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before running the script. This suggests a student question about how to properly authenticate with the OpenAI API and a clear path to resolution.py` where the OpenAI client is initialized, showing `client = OpenAI(`. The full error message, `openai.OpenAIError: The api_key client option must be set either by passing api_key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable`, means the student has not properly configured the OpenAI API key, either by directly passing it during client initialization or setting it as an environment variable. The student needs to either add `api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"` within the `OpenAI()` call or set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to resolve this error." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="uzReAwAPsgAOBKSrr4jwARzOkLg" width="690" height="55" data-dominant-color="161616">image1831Ã—146 7.91 KB
