**[Discussion Image by 23f3001745]** This image is a screenshot showing an automated test failure for a TDS project, likely related to formatting a markdown file. The "EXPECTED" output shows the desired markdown formatting including a header, a table with columns Start, Mid, and End, along with a paragraph and a python code block that prints an email. The "RESULT" section displays the actual output generated by the student's code, which contains incorrect newline characters ("\n") and extra spaces and trailing whitespace, indicated by error message "Paragraph has extra spaces and trailing whitespace". The student's actual output doesn't match the expected format, causing the test "A2" to fail, and shows python code `print("23f3001745@ds.study.iitm.ac.in")` enclosed in "```py" blocks. This output reveals that the student is struggling with proper markdown formatting and incorporating newlines and correct spacing. required output format, including a Markdown header "# Header", a table with columns "Start", "Mid", and "End", and a paragraph that includes the words "extra spaces and trailing whitespace", along with the python code "print("23f3001745@ds.study.iitm.ac.in")". The "RESULT" section reveals that the student's code failed the test, indicated by "X A2 FAILED". The output contains formatting errors such as incorrect newline characters (`\n`), and the paragraph "Paragraph has extra spaces and trailing whitespace" isn't formatted correctly causing the test to fail." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="g2HlbzZmJzgiPojlLNz4l8Gocqt" width="690" height="221" data-dominant-color="FCFCFC">image1340Ã—431 9.45 KB
