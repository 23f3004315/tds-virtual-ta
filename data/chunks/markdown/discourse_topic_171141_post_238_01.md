 during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor.

Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.

The email states that to pass Project 1, the student's GitHub repository must exist, be publicly accessible, contain a MIT LICENSE file, and contain a valid Dockerfile. Additionally, the Docker image must be publicly accessible and run with the command `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` and use the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repo. The email shows that the Docker image prerequisite passed, but the checks for Github repository presence, the Dockerfile, and the MIT license all failed, resulting in an overall "FAIL" status for the prerequisites. and public, but the GitHub repository is failing to be found as public, as well as issues with the Dockerfile and MIT license in the root of the GitHub repo, resulting in an overall "Prerequisites: FAIL" status. This demonstrates a common scenario where students struggle with initial project setup and repository configuration, needing to ensure their repository is publicly accessible and contains the required files in the correct locations." alt="Screenshot 2025-04-01 020618" data-base62-sha1="rAtKM461XD9XoJ6jwMBzL4HpfnB" width="690" height="344" srcset="**[Discussion Image by 23f1002643]** This image shows an automated email sent to a student (22t1 se2002) regarding their Project 1 prerequisites.

The email states that the GitHub repository must exist, be publicly accessible, and contain a LICENSE file with the MIT license, and a valid Dockerfile. Additionally, the Docker image must be publicly accessible and run using the specified podman command. The student's prerequisite evaluation reveals that while the Docker image is present and public, the GitHub repository itself, the Dockerfile, and the MIT license are all failing the checks. The overall prerequisite check results in a "FAIL" status, meaning that the student needs to resolve these issues to pass the project prerequisites. The email emphasizes that failure to meet the minimum requirements will prevent evaluation of the student's submission. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by 23f1002643]** This image shows an automated email response from the TDS (likely The Data Science) course system to a student named "Learner" regarding their Project 1 submission. The email outlines project prerequisites, including the GitHub repository existing and being public, containing a LICENSE file (MIT license), having a valid Dockerfile, and ensuring the Docker image is publicly accessible and uses the same Dockerfile. The email further reports the student's project 1 prerequisite evaluations, showing that while the Docker image is present and public on Dockerhub (PASS), the Github repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license are all failing (FAIL) for presence and accessibility. Because of the failures, the overall project prerequisites status is reported as FAIL and this indicates the student will not get evaluated. The included `podman run` command provides an example for running the Docker image. 2x" data-dominant-color="F6F6F7">Screenshot 2025-04-01 0206181335Ã—667 57.9 KB
