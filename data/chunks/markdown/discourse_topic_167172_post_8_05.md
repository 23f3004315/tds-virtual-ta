**[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image depicts a student troubleshooting an issue with their Project 1 code, likely related to file handling. The screenshot shows a Postman request, specifically a POST request sent to `http://localhost:8000/run?task=The file ./data/dates.txt co`. The "Params" section indicates that a "task" parameter is being sent, containing the string "The file ./data/dates.txt c...". The response body in JSON format reveals an error: `"error": "Failed to count Wednesdays: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './data/dates.txt'"` indicating that the program cannot find the specified dates.txt file, likely due to an incorrect file path. The student is encountering a "No such file or directory" error, meaning their program is unable to locate the specified file in the file system.status. The student is likely confused because the server is running but can't locate the file, indicating a potential problem with file paths or working directories." alt="Screenshot 2025-02-14 231752" data-base62-sha1="8CWFUFCn1rd2HZakNRDmzHnnKmR" width="690" height="411" srcset="**[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image illustrates a student encountering a file not found error while working on Project 1, likely related to a POST request. The student is using Postman to send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/run` with a parameter named "task" set to "The file ./data/dates.txt...". The server responds with a 200 OK status, however, the JSON response body contains an error message: `"error": "Failed to count Wednesdays: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './data/dates.txt'"`. This indicates that the server-side code is unable to locate the file specified in the 'task' parameter, suggesting a potential issue with the file path or file accessibility relative to the server's working directory. The student needs to verify the file path and ensure the server has the correct permissions to access the 'dates.txt' file., **[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image depicts a student's troubleshooting process using a tool like Postman to interact with a web application for their project. The student is sending a POST request to the endpoint `http://localhost:8000/run` with a parameter named "task" whose value specifies a file path "./data/dates.txt". The server returns a 200 OK status, but the JSON response contains an error message: `"error": "Failed to count Wednesdays: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './data/dates.txt'"` indicating the application cannot find the specified data file. This suggests the student's file path is incorrect or the file does not exist in the expected location relative to the application's execution context. The student is likely seeking assistance because the file path resolution is failing, preventing the application from processing the data. 1.5x, **[Discussion Image by Sakshi6479]** This image depicts a student's attempt to debug an error encountered while working on project1, specifically related to file detection after sending a POST request, showcasing a peer discussion element. The student is sending a POST request to "http://localhost:8000/run" with a parameter named "task" set to "The file ./data/dates.txt c...". The response body, formatted as JSON, contains an error message: ""error": "Failed to count Wednesdays: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './data/dates.txt'"". This indicates the application is unable to locate the specified file "./data/dates.txt", suggesting a problem with the file path. While the request itself returns a 200 OK status, the JSON body reveals the underlying error preventing successful execution of the task. The student is likely troubleshooting why the file path provided in the "task" parameter is not being correctly resolved by the application. 2x" data-dominant-color="272828">Screenshot 2025-02-14 2317521786Ã—1065 74.8 KB
