**[Discussion Image by Kabir1203]** This image captures a student's interaction within the "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent" discussion thread, showing the content of a `format.md` file. The file contains unformatted Markdown text including a paragraph with extra spaces and trailing whitespace, as well as a list with mixed list item markers (- + *). A Python code block, denoted by triple backticks, includes the line `print("user@example.com")`. This setup suggests the student might be experimenting with or troubleshooting issues related to Markdown formatting and code execution within the LLM agent. The file's presence within the `data` directory indicates it's likely used as input or example data for the project. This likely forms the basis of a student question around markdown formatting expectations in the project.ontains a sample paragraph with formatting issues such as extra spaces and trailing whitespace. It also includes a bulleted list with varying bullet characters like '-', '+', and '*'. Notably, the file demonstrates embedding Python code within the markdown using code fences (```py), displaying a simple print statement: `print("user@example.com")`. This suggests the student is exploring how the LLM agent handles and formats markdown files, potentially dealing with code extraction or formatting. The file serves as a test case for the agent's ability to process and clean up markdown content." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="AuRedeLNq2Tt2gwfYe8yPG9wrng" width="690" height="339" data-dominant-color="232323">image820Ã—404 12.3 KB
