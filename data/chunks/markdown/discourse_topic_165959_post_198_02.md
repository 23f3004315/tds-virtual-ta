**[Discussion Image by 23f2000573]** This image shows a browser window displaying the output of a Python "pretty-print" operation within the context of a TDS Jan 2025 GA4 data sourcing discussion. The browser's address bar shows "127.0.0.1:8000/?country=india", indicating a local server is running and receiving a query parameter "country" with the value "india." The content rendered in the browser is the numerical value "44", likely resulting from code executed on the server based on the "country" parameter. This suggests a student is testing server-side logic and observing the output in their browser, possibly as part of a data sourcing or API interaction exercise in the TDS course. This is either a student demonstrating the results of their work, or asking for help debugging why the server output is `44` when they expected something else.es the student is querying the server at `127.0.0.1:8000` with a `country` parameter set to `india`, suggesting they are working with data filtered by country. The server response is simply the number "44", displayed prominently on the page, which likely represents a count or some aggregated metric related to India within the dataset. The student's goal seems to be verifying data filtering or extraction based on URL parameters within their local development environment. The "Pretty-print" text suggests a debugging or output formatting context." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="oZLQP2iVKs1z9MChe8Ui8W4vKRl" width="690" height="213" data-dominant-color="2C2C2D">image766×237 12.2 KB
