**[Discussion Image by 23f2003717]** This image captures a student's question regarding their repository URL during the "GA2 - Deployment Tools" assignment. The student input their repository URL `https://github.com/NAMAN-BERI/actions.git`, but received an error message: "Error: No runs found." This indicates an issue with GitHub Actions not finding any workflow runs associated with the provided repository, potentially because no workflows are defined or have been triggered yet. The student likely needs to define a GitHub Actions workflow in their repository for the deployment tool to function correctly. This could involve creating a `.github/workflows/` directory and a YAML file to define the workflow steps.https://github.com/USER/REPO". The student provides the URL "https://github.com/NAMAN-BERI/actions.git", but encounters the error message "Error: No runs found". This suggests the system is unable to find any execution history or existing workflows associated with that repository, indicating a potential setup or configuration issue with GitHub Actions." alt="image" data-base62-sha1="7XNTKmQA373PknVu3HI2HwOXY0s" width="690" height="134" data-dominant-color="2E2F34">image697×136 8.17 KB
